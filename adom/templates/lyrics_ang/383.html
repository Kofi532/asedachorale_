HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 We plow the fields and scatter <br> the good seed on the land, <br> but it is fed and watered <br> by Gods almighty hand. <br> God sends the snow in winter, <br> the warmth to swell the grain, <br> the breezes, and the sunshine, <br> and soft refreshing rain. <br> Refrain: <br> All good gifts around us are sent from heavn above. <br> We thank you, God, we thank you, God, for all your love. <br> <br>2 You only are the Maker <br> of all things near and far. <br> You paint the wayside flower, <br> you light the evening star. <br> The winds and waves obey you, <br> by you the birds are fed; <br> much more to us, your children, <br> you give our daily bread. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 We thank you, then, Creator, <br> for all things bright and good, <br> the seed-time, and the harvest, <br> our life, our health, our food. <br> Accept the gifts we offer <br> for all your love imparts, <br> and what you most would welcome: <br> our humble, thankful hearts. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: Voices Together #<br>747</p>
