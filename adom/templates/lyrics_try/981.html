<p><br/>1 Christ is the foundation <br/> Of the house we raise; <br/> Be its walls salvation, <br/> And its gateways praise. <br/> May its threshold lowly <br/> To the Lord be dear, <br/> May the hearts be holy <br/> That shall worship here. <br/> <br/>2 On the Rock of Ages, <br/> Resting broad and deep, <br/> When life's tempest rages <br/> Here let passion sleep: <br/> Here may prayer and praises <br/> Never cease to rise, <br/> Till, through Christ, they raise us <br/> Nearer to the skies. <br/> <br/>3 Here may faith attending <br/> Find fruition fair; <br/> Here may spirits bending <br/> Breathe the breath of prayer: <br/> Here may holy gladness <br/> Fill the waiting heart, <br/> Until sin and sadness <br/> Evermore depart. <br/> <br/>4 Here may every token <br/> Of thy presence be, <br/> Here may chains be broken, <br/> Prisoners here set free: <br/> Here may light illumine <br/> Every soul of Thine, <br/> Lifting up the human <br/> Unto the divine. <br/> <br/>5 Here may God the Father, <br/> God the Saviour, Son, <br/> God the Holy Spirit, <br/> Be adored as One; <br/> Till the whole creation <br/> At Thy footstool fall, <br/> And in adoration <br/> Own Thee Lord of all. <br/> Amen. <br/> <br/> Source: The Hymnal and Order of Service #<br/>279</p>
