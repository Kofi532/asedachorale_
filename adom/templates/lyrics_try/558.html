        <p><br>1 Saviour from sin, I wait to prove <br> That Jesus is thy healing name, <br> To lose, when perfected in love, <br> Whate'er I have, or can, or am; <br> I stay me on thy faithful word, <br> The servant shall be as his lOrd. <br> <br>2 Answer that gracious end in me, <br> For which thy precious life was given, <br> Redeem from all iniquity, <br> Restore and make me meet for heaven; <br> Unless thou purge my every stain, <br> Thy suffering and my faith are vain. <br> <br>3 'Tis not a bare release from sin, <br> Its guilt and pain, my soul requires, <br> I want a spirit of power within; <br> Thee, Jesus, thee my heart desires, <br> And pants, and breaks to be renew'd, <br> And wash'd in thine all-cleansing blood. <br> <br>4 Didst thou not die that I might live <br> No longer to myself, but thee? <br> Might, body, soul, and spirit give <br> To him who gave himself for me? <br> Come then, my Master, and my God, <br> Take the dear purchase of thy blood. <br> <br>5 Thine own peculiar servant claim, <br> For thine own truth and mercy's sake, <br> Hallow in me thy glorious name, <br> Me for thine own this moment take, <br> And change and throughly purify: <br> Thine only may I lie and dine. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: A Pocket hymn-book, designed as a constant companion for the pious: collected from various authors (<br>11th ed.) #CCLXXII</p>
