<p><br/>1. Be with us, gracious Lord, today; <br/> This house we dedicate to Thee; <br/> O hear Thy servants as they pray, <br/> And let Thine ear attentive be! <br/> <br/>2. Within these walls let holy peace, <br/> Let love and truth be always found; <br/> May burdened hearts and sweet release, <br/> And souls with richest grace be crowned. <br/> <br/>3. May here be heard the suppliantÂs sigh, <br/> The weary enter into rest; <br/> Here may the contrite to Thee cry, <br/> And waiting souls be richly blessed. <br/> <br/>4. Here when the Gospel sound is heard, <br/> And here proclaimed the saving name, <br/> May hearts be quickened, moved and stirred, <br/> And souls be kindled into flame. <br/> <br/>5. Here may the dead be made to live, <br/> The dumb to sing, the deaf to hear; <br/> And do Thou to the humble give <br/> Pardon and peace instead of fear. <br/> <br/>6. Make this, O Lord, Thine own abode; <br/> Thy presence in these courts be givÂn; <br/> Be this, indeed, the house of God, <br/> And this in truth the gate of HeavÂn. <br/> <br/> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br/>696</p>
