        <p><br>1 When on my day of life the night is falling, <br> And in the winds from unsunned spaces blown <br> I hear far voices out of darkness calling <br> My feet to paths unknown-- <br> <br>2 Thou, who hast made my home of life so pleasant, <br> Leave not its tenant when its walls decay; <br> O Love Divine, O Helper ever present, <br> Be Thou my strength and stay! <br> <br>3 Be near me when all else is from me drifting <br> Earth, sky, home's pictures, days of shade and shine, <br> And kindly faces to my own uplifting <br> The love which answers mine. <br> <br>4 I have but Thee, my Father! let Thy Spirit <br> Be with me then to comfort and uphold; <br> No gate of pearl, no branch of palm I merit, <br> Nor street of shining gold. <br> <br>5 Suffice it if my good and ill unreckoned, <br> And both forgiven through Thy abounding grace <br> I find myself by hands familiar beckoned <br> Unto my fitting place. <br> <br>6 Some humble door among Thy many mansions, <br> Some sheltering shade where sin and striving cease, <br> And flows for ever through heaven's green expansions <br> The river of Thy peace. <br> <br>7 There from the music round about me stealing <br> I fain would learn the new and holy song. <br> And find at last, beneath Thy trees of healing, <br> The life for which I long. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>468a</p>
