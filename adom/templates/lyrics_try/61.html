        <p><br>1. Earth, with all thy thousand voices, <br> Praise in songs th'eternal King; <br> Praise His name, whose praise rejoices <br> Ears that hear, and tongues that sing. <br> Lord, from each far-peopled dwelling, <br> Earth shall raise the glad acclaim; <br> All shall kneel, Thy greatness telling, <br> Sing Thy praise and bless Thy name. <br> <br>2. Come and hear the wondrous story, <br> How our mighty God of old, <br> In the terrors of His glory, <br> Back the flowing billows rolled; <br> Walked within the threatening waters, <br> Free we passed the upright wave, <br> Then was joy to Israel's daughters, <br> Loud they sang His power to save. <br> <br>3. Bless the Lord, who ever liveth; <br> Sound His praise through every land, <br> Who our dying souls reviveth, <br> By whose arm upheld we stand. <br> Now upon this cheerful morrow <br> We Thine altars will adorn, <br> And the gifts we vowed in sorrow <br> Pay on joy's returning morn. <br> <br>4. Come, each faithful soul, who fearest, <br> Him who fills th'eternal throne: <br> Hear, rejoicing while thou hearest, <br> What our God for us hath done; <br> When we made our supplication, <br> When our voice in prayer was strong, <br> Then we found His glad salvation; <br> And His mercy fills our tongue. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1394</p>
