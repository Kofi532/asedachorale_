<p><br/>1 Across the sky the shades of night <br/> This New Year's Eve are fleeting. <br/> We deck Your altar, Lord, with light, <br/> In solemn worship meeting: <br/> And as the year's last hours go by, <br/> We raise to You our earnest cry, <br/> Once more Your love entreating. <br/> <br/>2 Before the cross subdued we bow, <br/> To You our prayers addressing, <br/> Recounting all Your mercies now, <br/> And all our sins confessing; <br/> Beseeching You this coming year <br/> To keep us in Your faith and fear <br/> And crown us with Your blessing. <br/> <br/>3 We gather up in this brief hour <br/> The mem'ry of Your mercies: <br/> Your wondrous goodness, love, and pow'r <br/> Our grateful song rehearses: <br/> For You have been our strength and stay <br/> In many a dark and dreary day <br/> Of sorrow and reverses. <br/> <br/>4 [Protected by copyright] <br/> <br/>5 Then, gracious God, in years to come, <br/> We pray Your hand may guide us, <br/> And, onward through our journey home, <br/> Your mercy walk beside us <br/> Until at last our ransomed life <br/> Is safe from peril, toil, and strife <br/> When heav'n itself shall hide us. <br/> <br/> <br/> Source: Lutheran Service Book #<br/>899</p>
