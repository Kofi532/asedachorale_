        <p><br>1 All things are possible to him <br> That can in JesusÂ name believe; <br> Lord, I no mote thy truth blaspheme, <br> Thy truth I lovingly receive; <br> I can, I do believe in thee; <br> All things are possible to me. <br> <br>2 The most impossible of all <br> Is that I eÂer from sin should cease; <br> Yet shall it be; I know it shall; <br> Jesus, look to thy faithfulness! <br> If nothing is too hard for thee, <br> All things are possible to me. <br> <br>3 Though earth and Hell the word gainsay, <br> The word of God can never fail; <br> The Lamb shall take my sins away, <br> ÂTis certain, though impossible; <br> The thing impossible shall be, <br> All things are possible to me. <br> <br>4 When thou the work of faith hast wrought, <br> I here shall in thine image shine, <br> Nor sin in deed or word or thought; <br> Let men exclaim and fiends repine, <br> They cannot break the firm decree; <br> All things are possible to me. <br> <br>5 Thy mouth, O Lord, to me hath sworn <br> That I shall serve thee without fear, <br> Shall find the pearl which others spurn, <br> Holy and pure and perfect here; <br> The servant as his Lord shall be; <br> All things are possible to me. <br> <br>6 All things are possible to God, <br> To Christ, the power of God in man, <br> To me, when I am all renewed, <br> When I in Christ am formed again, <br> And witness, from all sin set free, <br> All things are possible to me. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The Song Book of the Salvation Army #<br>407</p>
