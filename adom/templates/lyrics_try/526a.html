        <p><br>1 O Jesus, I have promised <br> to serve Thee to the end; <br> be Thou forever near me, <br> my Master and my Friend; <br> I shall not fear the battle <br> if Thou art by my side, <br> nor wander from the pathway <br> if Thou wilt be my Guide. <br> <br>2 O let me feel Thee near me, <br> the world is ever near; <br> I see the sights that dazzle, <br> the tempting sounds I hear; <br> my foes are ever near me, <br> around me and within; <br> but, Jesus, draw Thou nearer, <br> and shield my soul from sin. <br> <br>3 O let me hear Thee speaking <br> in accents clear and still, <br> above the storms of passion, <br> the murmurs of self-will; <br> O speak to reassure me, <br> to hasten or control! <br> O speak, and make me listen, <br> Thou Guardian of my soul! <br> <br>4 O Jesus, Thou hast promised <br> to all who follow Thee <br> that where Thou art in glory <br> there shall Thy servant be; <br> and, Jesus, I have promised <br> to serve Thee to the end; <br> O give me grace to follow, <br> my Master and my Friend! <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>364</p>
