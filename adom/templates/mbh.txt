HYMN 100
1 One there is, above all others,   well deserves the name of Friend;   His is love beyond a brother's,   costly, free, and knows no end;   they who once His kindness prove,   find it everlasting love!    2 Which of all our friends to save us,   could or would have shed their blood?   But our Jesus died to have us   reconciled in Him to God;   this was boundless love indeed!   Jesus is a Friend in need.    3 Men, when raised to lofty stations,   often know their friends no more;   slight and scorn their poor relations   though they valued them before.   But our Savior always owns   those whom He redeemed with groans.    4 When He lived on earth abased,   Friend of sinners was His name;   now, above all glory raised,   He rejoices in the same;   still He calls them brethren, friends,   and to all their wants attends.    5 Could we bear from one another,   what He daily bears from us?   Yet this glorious Friend and Brother   loves us though we treat Him thus;   though for good we render ill,   He accounts us brethren still.    6 O for grace our hearts to soften!   Teach us, Lord, at length to love;   we, alas! forget too often   what a Friend we have above;   but when home our souls are brought,   we will love Thee as we ought.

1 Rest of the weary,   Joy of the sad;   Hope of the dreary,   Light of the glad;   Home of the stranger,   Strength to the end;   Refuge from danger,   Saviour and Friend!    2 Pillow where, lying,   Love rests its head;   Peace of the dying,   Life of the dead;   Path of the lowly,   Prize at the end;   Breath of the holy,   Saviour and Friend!    3 When my feet stumble,   I to Thee cry;   Crown of the humble,   cross of the high;   When my steps wander,   Over me bend,   Truer and fonder,   Saviour and Friend!    4 Ever confessing   Thee, I will raise   Unto Thee blessing,   Glory, and praise:   All my endeavour,   World without end,   Thine to be ever,   Saviour and Friend 1       Source: Redemption Songs: a choice collection of  1000 hymns and choruses for evangelistic meetings, solo singers, choirs and the home # 45

HYMN 102
1 Immortal Love for ever full,   for ever flowing free,   for ever shared, for ever whole,   a never-ebbing sea. 2 Our outward lips confess the name   all other names above;   love only knoweth whence it came   and comprehendeth love. 3 We may not climb the heavenly steeps   to bring the Lord Christ down;   in vain we search the lowest deeps,   for him no depths can drown: 4 But warm, sweet, tender, even yet   a present help is he;   and faith has still its Olivet,   and love its Galilee. 5 The healing of his seamless dress   is by our beds of pain;   we touch him in life's throng and press,   and we are whole again. 6 Through him the first fond prayers are said   our lips of childhood frame;   the last low whispers of our dead   are burdened with his name. 7 Alone, O Love ineffable,   thy saving name is given;   to turn aside from thee is hell,   to walk with thee is heaven.

1 O Lord and Master of us all,   whateÂer our name or sign,   we own thy sway, we hear thy call,   we test our lives by Thine.    2 Thou judgest us; thy purity   doth all our lusts condemn;   the love that draws us nearer thee   is hot with wrath to them.    3 Yet weak and blinded though we be,   thou dost our service own;   we bring our varying gifts to thee,   and thou rejectest none.    4 Apart from thee all gain is loss,   all labor vainly done;   the solemn shadow of the cross   is better than the sun.    5 We faintly hear, we dimly see,   in diff'ring phrase we pray;   but, dim or clear, we own in thee   the Life, the Truth, the Way.

HYMN 106
1 Jesu! -- the very thought is sweet!   In that dear name all heart-joys meet;   But sweeter than the honey far   The glimpses of his presence are.    2 No word is sung more sweet than this:   No name is heard more full of bliss:   No thought brings sweeter comfort nigh,   Than Jesus, Son of God most high.    3 Jesu! the hope of souls forlorn!   How good to them for sin that mourn!   To them that seek thee, O how kind!   But what art thou to them that find?    4 Jesu, thou sweetness, pure and blest,   TruthÂs fountain, Light of souls distrest,   Surpassing all that heart requires,   Exceeding all that soul desires!    5 No tongue of mortal can express,   No letters write its blessedness:   Alone who hath thee in his heart   Knows, love of Jesus, what thou art.    6 *I seek for Jesus in repose,   When round my heart its chambers close;   Abroad, and when I shut the door,   I long for Jesus evermore.    7 *With Mary in the morning gloom   I seek for Jesus at the tomb;   For him with love's most earnest cry,   I seek with heart and not with eye.    8 *Jesus, to God the Father gone,   Is seated on the heavenly throne;   My heart hath also passed from me,   That where he is there it may be.    9 We follow Jesus now, and raise   The voice of prayer, the hymn of praise,   That He at last may make us meet   With him to gain the heavenly seat. Amen.       Source: The New English Hymnal # 291a

1 Jesus, the very thought of thee   with sweetness fills the breast;   but sweeter far thy face to see,   and in thy presence rest.    2 O hope of every contrite heart,   O joy of all the meek,   to those who fall, how kind thou art!   How good to those who seek!    3 But what to those who find? Ah, this   nor tongue nor pen can show;   the love of Jesus, what it is,   none but his loved ones know.    4 Jesus, our only joy be thou,   as thou our prize wilt be;   Jesus, be thou our glory now,   and through eternity.

1 Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts,   Thou fount of life, Thou light of men,   from the best bliss that earth imparts,   we turn unfilled to Thee again.    2 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;   Thou savest those that on Thee call;   to them that seek Thee, Thou art good,   to them that find Thee all in all.    3 We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,   and long to feast upon Thee still;   we drink of Thee, the Fountain-head,   and thirst our souls from Thee to fill.    4 Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,   where'er our changeful lot is cast;   glad when Thy gracious smile we see,   blest when our faith can hold Thee fast.    5 O Jesus, ever with us stay,   make all our moments calm and bright;   chase the dark night of sin away;   shed o'er the world Thy holy light.

1 Jesus, lover of my soul,   let me to thy bosom fly,   while the nearer waters roll,   while the tempest still is high;   hide me, O my Savior, hide,   till the storm of life is past;   safe into the haven guide,   O receive my soul at last!    2 Other refuge have I none;   hangs my helpless soul on thee;   leave, ah! leave me not alone,   still support and comfort me.   All my trust on thee is stayed,   all my help from thee I bring;   cover my defenseless head   with the shadow of thy wing.    3 Plenteous grace with thee is found,   grace to cover all my sin;   let the healing streams abound;   make and keep me pure within.   Thou of life the fountain art;   freely let me take of thee;   spring thou up within my heart,   rise to all eternity.   Psalter Hymnal,  1987

1 Jesus, these eyes have never seen   that radiant form of thine;   the veil of sense hangs dark between   thy blessÃÂ¨d face and mine.    2 I see thee not, I hear thee not,   yet art thou oft with me;   and earth hath ne'er so dear a spot   as where I meet with thee.    3 Yet, though I have not seen, and still   must rest in faith alone,   I love thee, dearest Lord, and will,   unseen, but not unknown.    4 When death these mortal eyes shall seal,   and still this throbbing heart,   the rending veil shall thee reveal   all glorious as thou art.

HYMN 112
1. I bless the Christ of God,   I rest on love divine,   And with unfaltering lip and heart,   I call the Savior mine.   His cross dispels each doubt;   I bury in His tomb   Each thought of unbelief and fear,   Each lingering shade of gloom.    2. I praise the God of peace,   I trust His truth and might;   He calls me His, I call Him mine,   My God, my Joy, my Light.   In Him is only good,   in me is only ill;   My ill but draws His goodness forth,   And me He loveth still.    3. 'Tis He who saveth me,   and freely pardon gives;   I love because He loveth me;   I live because He lives;   My life with Him is hid,   my death has passed away,   My clouds have melted into light,   My midnight into day.

1 LET earth and heaven agree,   Angels and men be joined,   To celebrate with me   The Saviour of mankind;   To adore the all-atoning Lamb,   And bless the sound of Jesu's name. 2 Jesus, transporting sound!   The joy of earth and heaven;   No other help is found,   No other name is given,   By which we can salvation have;   But Jesus came the world to save. 3 Jesus, harmonious name!   It charms the hosts above;   They evermore proclaim   And wonder at His love;   ÃÂTis all their happiness to gaze   ÃÂTis heaven to see our Jesu's face. 4 His name the sinner hears,   And is from sin set free;   ÃÂTis music in his ears,   ÃÂTis life and victory;   New songs do now his lips employ,   And dances his glad heart for joy, 5 Stung by the scorpion sin,   My poor expiring soul   The balmy sound drinks in,   And is at once made whole:   See there my Lord upon the tree!   I hear, I feel, He died for me. 6 O unexampled love!   O all-redeeming grace!   How swiftly didst Thou move   To save a fallen race!   What shall I do to make it known   What Thou for all mankind hast done? 7 O for a trumpet voice,   On all the world to call;   To bid their hearts rejoice   In Him who died for all;   For all my Lord was crucified,   For all, for all my Saviour died!

1 MY heart and voice I raise,   To spread Messiah's praise;   Messiah's praise let all repeat;   The universal Lord,   By whose almighty word   Creation rose in form complete. 2 A servant's form He wore,   And in His body bore   Our dreadful curse on Calvary:   He like a victim stood,   And poured His sacred blood,   To the guilty captives free. 3 But soon the Victor rose   Triumphant o'er His foes,   And led the vanquished host in chains:   He threw their empire down,   His foes compelled to own,   O'er all the great Messiah reigns. 4 With mercy's mildest grace,   He governs all our race   In wisdom, righteousness, and love:   Who to Messiah fly   Shall find redemption nigh,   And all His great salvation prove. 5 Hail, Saviour, Prince of Peace!

HYMN 120
1 Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,   whereon the Savior of the world was born;   rise to adore the mystery of love,   which hosts of angels chanted from above;   with them the joyful tidings were begun   of God incarnate and the virgin's Son.    2 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,   who heard th'angelic herald's voice: "Behold,   I bring good tidings of a Savior's birth   to you and all the nations of the earth;   this day hath God fulfilled His promised word;   this day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord."    3 He spake, and straightway the celestial choir   in hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire;   the praises of redeeming love they sang,   and heav'n's whole orb with alleluias rang;   God's highest glory was their anthem still,   peace on the earth, and unto men good will.    4 To Bethl'hem straight the happy shepherds ran,   to see the wonder God had wrought for man;   and found, with Joseph and the blessed maid,   her Son, the Savior, in a manger laid;   amazed, the wondrous story they proclaim,   the earliest heralds of the Savior's name.    5 Oh, may we keep and ponder in our mind   God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind!   Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,   from His poor manger to His bitter cross.   Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,   till our imperfect state God doth replace.    6 Then may we hope, th'angelic hosts among,   to sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song;   He that was born upon this joyful day   around us all His glory shall display;   saved by His love, incessant we shall sing   eternal praise to heav'n's almighty King.

1 All my heart this night rejoices   as I hear far and near   sweetest angel voices.   "Christ is born," their choirs are singing   till the air ev'rywhere   now with joy is ringing.    2 Forth today the Conqu'ror goeth,   who the foe, sin and woe,   death and hell, o'erthroweth.   God is man, man to deliver;   His dear Son now is one   with our blood forever.    3 Shall we still dread God's displeasure,   who, to save, freely gave   His most cherished Treasure?   To redeem us, He hath given   His own Son from the throne   of His might in heaven.    4 He becomes the Lamb that taketh   sin away and for aye   full atonement maketh.   For our life His own He tenders;   and our race, by His grace,   fit for glory renders.    5 Hark! a voice from yonder manger,   soft and sweet, doth entreat,   "Flee from woe and danger;   brethren, from all ills that grieve you   you are freed; all you need   I will surely give you."    6 Come, then, banish all your sadness,   one and all, great and small;   come with songs of gladness.   Love Him who with love is glowing;   hail the star, near and far   light and joy bestowing.    7 Dearest Lord, Thee will I cherish.   Though my breath fail in death,   yet I shall not perish,   but with Thee abide for ever   there on high, in that joy   which can vanish never.     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 247

1 See, amid the winter's snow,   born for us on earth below,   see the tender Lamb appears,   promised from eternal years.   Refrain:   Hail, thou ever blessed morn!   Hail, redemption's happy dawn!   Sing through all Jerusalem,   "Christ is born in Bethlehem."    2 Lo, within a manger lies   He who built the starry skies;   He who, throned in height sublime,   sits amid the cherubim! [Refrain]    3 Say, ye holy shepherds, say,   what's your joyful news today?   Wherefore have ye left your sheep   on the lonely mountain steep? [Refrain]    4 "As we watched at dead of night,   Lo! we saw a wondrous light;   angels singing 'Peace on earth'   told us of the Savior's birth." [Refrain]    5 Sacred Infant, all divine,   what a tender love was Thine,   thus to come from highest bliss   down to such a world as this! [Refrain]    6 Teach, O teach us, Holy Child,   by Thy face so meek and mild,   teach us to resemble Thee,   in Thy sweet humility! [Refrain]       Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 248

HYMN 125
1 O little town of Bethlehem,   how still we see thee lie!   Above thy deep and dreamless sleep   the silent stars go by.   Yet in thy dark streets shineth   the everlasting light;   the hopes and fears of all the years   are met in thee tonight.    2 For Christ is born of Mary;   and, gathered all above,   while mortals sleep, the angels keep   their watch of wond'ring love.   O morning stars, together   proclaim the holy birth,   and praises sing to God the King,   and peace to men on earth.    3 How silently, how silently,   the wondrous gift is giv'n!   So God imparts to human hearts   the blessings of His heav'n.   No ear may hear His coming,   but in this world of sin,   where meek souls will receive Him still,   the dear Christ enters in.    4 O holy Child of Bethlehem,   descend to us, we pray;   cast out our sin and enter in;   be born in us today.   We hear the Christmas angels,   the great glad tidings tell;   O come to us, abide with us,   our Lord Emmanuel!       Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 232

1 Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes;   Who is it in you manger lies?   Who is this Child, so young and fair?   The blessed Christ-child lieth there.    2 Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,   Make Thee a bed, soft-undefiled,   Within my heart, that it may be   A quiet chamber kept for Thee.    3 My heart for very joy doth leap,   My lips no more can silence keep;   I too must sing with joyful tongue,   That sweetest ancient cradle-song:    4 Glory to God in highest heaven,   Who unto man His Son hath given;   While angels sing with pious mirth,   A glad new year to all the earth.   Amen.     Source: Voices of Praise: for school and church and home # 51

1. Cradled in a manger, meanly,   Laid the Son of Man His head;   Sleeping His first earthly slumber   Where the oxen had been fed.   Happy were those shepherds listening   To the holy angel's word;   Happy they within that stable   Worshipping their infant Lord.    2. Happy all who hear the message   Of His coming from above;   Happier still who hail His coming,   And with praises greet His love.   BlessÃÂ¨d Savior, Christ most holy,   In a manger Thou didst rest;   Canst Thou stoop again, yet lower,   And abide within my breast?    3. Evil things are there before Thee;   In the heart, where they have fed,   Wilt Thou pitifully enter,   Son of Man, and lay Thy head?   Enter, then, O Christ most holy;   Make a Christmas in my heart;   Make a heaven of my manger:   It is heaven where Thou art.    4. And to those who never listened   To the message of Thy birth,   Who have winter, but no Christmas   Bringing them Thy peace on earth,   Send to these the joyful tidings;   By all people, in each home,   Be there heard the Christmas anthem;   Praise to God, the Christ has come!

1. A virgin most pure, as the prophets do tell,   Hath brought forth a baby, as it hath befel,   To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,   Which Adam's transgression hath wrappÃÂ¨d us in.   (Chorus)   Aye and therefore be merry, rejoice and be you merry,   Set sorrow aside;   Christ Jesus our Saviour was born on this tide.    2. At Bethlem in Jewry a city there was   Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,   And there to be taxÃÂ¨d, with many one mo',   For Caesar commanded the same should be so. [Chorus]    3. But when they had entered the city so fair,   A number of people so mighty was there,   That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,   Could find in the inn there no lodging at all. [Chorus]    4. Then were they constrained in a stable to lie,   Where horses and asses they used for to tie;   Their lodging so simple they took it no scorn,   But against the next morning our Saviour was born. [Chorus]    5. The King of all kings to this world being brought,   Small store of fine linen to wrap him was sought,   And when she had swaddled her young son so sweet,   Within an ox-manger she laid him to sleep. [Chorus]    6. Then God sent an angel from Heaven so high,   To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,   And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,   Because that our Saviour was born on this day. [Chorus]    7. Then presently after the shepherds did spy   A number of angels that stood in the sky;   They joyfully talkÃÂ¨d, and sweetly did sing,   To God be all glory, our heavenly King.

HYMN 129
1 While shepherds watched their flocks by night,   all seated on the ground,   an angel of the Lord came down,   and glory shone around.    2 "Fear not," said he for mighty dread   had seized their troubled mind   "glad tidings of great joy I bring   to you and all mankind.    3 "To you, in David's town, this day   is born of David's line   a Savior, who is Christ the Lord;   and this shall be the sign:    4 "The heavenly babe you there shall find   to human view displayed,   all simply wrapped in swaddling clothes   and in a manger laid."    5 Thus spoke the angel. Suddenly   appeared a shining throng   of angels praising God, who thus   addressed their joyful song:    6 "All glory be to God on high,   and to the earth be peace;   to those on whom his favor rests   goodwill shall never cease."

HYMN 130
1 It came upon the midnight clear,   that glorious song of old,   from angels bending near the earth   to touch their harps of gold:   "Peace on the earth, good will to men,   from heaven's all-gracious King."   The world in solemn stillness lay,   to hear the angels sing.    2 Still through the cloven skies they come   with peaceful wings unfurled,   and still their heavenly music floats   o'er all the weary world;   above its sad and lowly plains,   they bend on hovering wing,   and ever o'er its Babel sounds   the blessed angels sing.    3 And ye, beneath life's crushing load,   whose forms are bending low,   who toil along the climbing way   with painful steps and slow,   look now! for glad and golden hours   come swiftly on the wing.   O rest beside the weary road,   and hear the angels sing!    4 For lo! the days are hastening on,   by prophet seen of old,   when with the ever-circling years   shall come the time foretold   when peace shall over all the earth   its ancient splendors fling,   and the whole world send back the song   which now the angels sing.

1 The first Nowell the angel did say   was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,   in fields where they lay keeping their sheep,   on a cold winter's night that was so deep.   Refrain:   Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,   born is the King of Israel.    2 They looked up and saw a star   shining in the east beyond them far;   and to the earth it gave great light,   and so it continued both day and night. [Refrain]    3 And by the light of that same star   three wise men came from country far;   to seek for a king was their intent,   and to follow the star wherever it went. [Refrain]    4 This star drew nigh to the northwest;   o'er Bethlehem it took its rest,   and there it did both stop and stay,   right over the place where Jesus lay. [Refrain]    5 Then entered in those wise men three,   full reverently upon their knee,   and offered there in his presence   their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense. [Refrain]    6 Then let us all with one accord   sing praises to our heavenly Lord,   that hath made heaven and earth of nought,   and with his blood our life hath bought.

1 As with gladness men of old   did the guiding star behold;   as with joy they hailed its light,   leading onward, beaming bright;   so, most gracious God, may we   evermore be led to Thee.    2 As with joyful steps they sped   to that lowly cradle-bed,   there to bend the knee before   Him whom heav'n and earth adore;   so may we with willing feet   ever seek Thy mercy-seat.    3 As they offered gifts most rare   at that cradle rude and bare;   so may we with holy joy,   pure, and free from sin's alloy,   all our costliest treasures bring,   Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.    4 Holy Jesus, every day   keep us in the narrow way;   and, when earthly things are past,   bring our ransomed lives at last   where they need no star to guide,   where no clouds Thy glory hide.    5 In that heav'nly country bright   need they no created light;   Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,   Thou its Sun which goes not down;   there for ever may we sing   alleluias to our King.

Then ÃÂCrucify!ÃÂ is all their breath,   and for His death they thirst and cry.    4 Why, what hath my Lord done?   What makes this rage and spite?   He made the lame to run;   He gave the blind their sight.   Sweet injuries! Yet they at these   themselves displease,   and 'gainst Him rise.    5 They rise, and needs will have   my dear Lord made away.   A murderer they save;   the Prince of Life they slay.   Yet cheerful He to suff'ring goes,   that He His foes from thence might free.    6 In life, no house, no home   my Lord on earth might have;   in death, no friendly tomb   but what a stranger gave.   What may I say? Heav'n was His home;   but mine the tomb wherein He lay.    7 Here might I stay and singÃÂ   no story so divine!   Never was love, dear King,   never was grief like Thine.   This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise   I all my days could gladly spend.       Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 260

1 What grace, O Lord, and beauty shone   around Your steps below!   What patient love was seen in all   Your life and death of woe!    2 For ever on Your burdened heart   a weight of sorrow hung,   yet no ungentle, murmuring word   escaped Your silent tongue.    3 Your foes might hate, despise, revile,   Your friends unfaithful prove;   unwearied in forgiveness still,   Your heart could only love.    4 O give us hearts to love like You,   like You, O Lord, to grieve   far more for others' sins than all   the wrongs that we receive.    5 One with Yourself, may every eye   in all of humankind   behold that grace and gentleness   which, Lord, in You we find.

HYMN 147
1 When the Lord of Love was here,   Happy hearts to Him were dear,   Though His heart was sad;   Worn and lonesome for our sake,   Yet he turned aside to make   All the weary glad.    2 Meek and lowly were His ways,   From His loving grew His praise,   From His giving, prayer;   All the outcast thronged to hear,   All the sorrowful drew near   To enjoy His care.    3 When he walked the fields, He drew   From the flowers and birds and dew   Parables of God;   For within His heart of love   All the soul of man did move,   God had His abode.    4 Lord, be ours Thy power to keep   In the very heart of grief,   And in trial, love;   In our meekness to be wise,   And through sorrows to arise   To our God above.    5 Fill us with Thy deep desire   All the sinful to inspire   With the Father's life;   Free us from the cares that press   On the heart of worldliness,   From the fret and strife.   Amen.     Source: The Hymnal # 141

1 We saw thee not when thou didst come   To this poor world of sin and death;   Nor yet beheld thy cottage home,   In that despised Nazareth;   But we believe thy footsteps trod   Its streets and plains, thou Son of God;   But we believe thy footsteps trod   Its streets and plains, thou Son of God.    2 We saw thee not when lifted high   Amid that wild and savage crew;   Nor heard we that imploring cry,   "Forgive, they know not what they do!"   But we believe the deed was done,   That shook the earth and veiled the sun;   But we believe the deed was done,   That shook the earth and veiled the sun.    3 We gazed not in the open tomb   Where once thy mangled body lay;   Nor saw thee in that "upper room,"   Nor met thee on the open way;   But we believe that angels said,   "Why seek the living with the dead?"   But we believe that angels said,   "Why seek the living with the dead?"    4 We walked not with the chosen few   Who saw thee from the earth ascend;   Who raised to heaven their wondering view,   Then low to earth all prostrate bend;   But we believe that human eyes   Beheld that journey to the skies;   But we believe that human eyes   Beheld that journey to the skies.

1 AND didst Thou love the race that loved not Thee?   And didst Thou take to heaven a human brow?   Dost plead with man's voice by the marvellous sea?   Art Thou his kinsman now? 2 O God. O kinsman, loved, but not enough!   O Man, with eyes majestic after death!   Whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,   Whose lips drawn human breath! 3 By that one likeness which is ours and Thine,   By that one nature which doth hold us kin,   By that high heaven where, sinless, Thou dost shine,   To draw us sinners in: 4 By Thy last silence in the judgment hall,   By long foreknowledge of the deadly tree,   By darkness, by the wormwood and the gall,   I pray Thee visit me. 5 Come, lest this heart should, cold and cast away,   Die e'er the Guest adored she entertainÃÂ   Lest eyes that never saw Thine earthly day   Should miss Thy heavenly reign.

1 Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,   When Thou camest to earth for me;   But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room   For Thy holy nativity.   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,   There is room in my heart for Thee.    2 Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,   Proclaiming Thy royal degree;   But of lowly birth didst Thou come to earth,   And in great humility.   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,   There is room in my heart for Thee.    3 The foxes found rest, and the birds their nest   In the shade of the forest tree;   But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,   In the deserts of Galilee.   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,   There is room in my heart for Thee.    4 Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word   That should set Thy people free;   But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,   They bore Thee to Calvary.   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,   There is room in my heart for Thee.    5 When the heavens shall ring, and the angels sing,   At Thy coming to victory,   Let Thy voice call me home, saying "Yet there is room,   There is room at My side for thee."   My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,   When Thou comest and callest for me.   Baptist Hymnal,  1991

1 Jesu, thy far-extended fame   My drooping soul exults to hear:   Thy name, thy all-restoring name,   Is music in a sinner's ear.    2 Sinners of old thou didst receive   With comfortable words and kind;   Their sorrows, cheer their wants relieve,   Heal the diseas'd, and cure the blind.    3 And art thou not the Saviour still,   In ev'ry place and age the same?   Hast thou forgot thy gracious skill,   Or lost the virtue of thy name?    4 Faith in thy changeless name I have;   The good, the kind physician, thou   Art able now our souls to save,   Art willing to restore them now.    5 Though seventeen hundred years are past,   Since thou didst in the flesh appear!   Thy tender mercies ever last!   And still thy healing pow'r is here.    6 Wouldst thou the body's health restore,   And not regard the sin-sick soul?   The sin-sick soul thou lov'st much more,   And surely thou shalt make it whole.    7 All my disease, my ev'ry sin,   To thee, O Jesus, I confess;   In pardon, Lord, my cure begin,   And perfect it in holiness.    8 That token of thine utmost good,   Now, Saviour, now on me bestow;   And purge my conscience with thy blood,   And wash my nature white as snow.

ÃÂSave us or we will surely die!ÃÂ   Your word above the storm rose high:   ÃÂPeace! be still.ÃÂ    3 The wild winds hushed; the angry deep   fell, like a little child, to sleep;   the sullen billows ceased to leap,   at your will.    4 So, when our life is clouded o'er,   and storm-winds drift us from the shore,   say, lest we sink to rise no more,   ÃÂPeace! be still.ÃÂ     Source: Voices Together # 286

1 Lord, it is good for us to be   High on the mountain here with Thee;   Where stand revealed to mortal gaze   Those glorious saints of other days;   Who once received on Horeb's height   The eternal laws of truth and right;   Or caught the still small whisper, higher   Than storm, than earthquake, or than fire.    2 Lord, it is good for us to be   Entranced, enwrapt, alone with Thee;   And watch Thy glistering raiment glow   Whiter than Hermon's whitest snow,   The human lineaments that shine   Irradiant with a light divine:   Till we too change from grace to grace,   Gazing on that transfigured face.    3 Lord, it is good for us to be   Here on the holy mount with Thee;   When darkling in the depths of night,   When dazzled with excess of light,   We bow before the heavenly voice   That bids bewildered souls rejoice,   Though love wax cold, and faith be dim,   "This is My Son; O hear ye Him!"   Amen.   The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord  1892

1 O the bitter shame and sorrow,   That a time could ever be   When I let the Saviour's pity   Plead in vain, and proudly answered:   All of self, and none of Thee!    2 Yet He found me; I beheld Him   Bleeding on the accursed tree,   Heard Him pray, Forgive them, Father!   And my wistful heart said faintly,   Some of self, and some of Thee!    3 Day by day His tender mercy,   Healing, helping, full and free,   Sweet and strong, and, ah! so patient,   Brought me lower, while I whispered:   Less of self, and more of Thee!    4 Higher than the highest heaven,   Deeper than the deepest sea,   Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered;   Grant me now my supplication,ÃÂ   None of self and all of Thee!

1 With glorious clouds encompast round,   Whom angels dimly see,   Will the unsearchable be found,   Or God appear to me?    2 Will he forsake his throne above,   Himself to worms impart?   Answer thou man of grief and love,   And speak it to my heart.    3 In manifested love explain   Thy wonderful design;   What meant the suff'ring son of man?   The streaming blood divine?    4 Didst thou not in our flesh appear,   And live and die below,   That I may now perceive thee near,   And my Redeemer know?    5 Come then, and to my soul reveal   The heights and depths of grace,   Those wounds which all my sorrows heal,   That dear disfigur'd face.    6 Before my eyes of faith confest,   Stand forth a slaughter'd Lamb:   And wrap me in thy crimson vest,   And tell me all thy name.    7 Jehovah in thy person show,   Jehovah crucify'd!   And then the pard'ning God I know,   And fell the blood apply'd.    8 I view the Lamb in his own light,   Whom angels dimly see:   And gaze, transported at the sight,   To all eternity.

1 Would Jesus have the sinner die?   Why hangs he then on yonder tree?   What means that strange expiring cry?   Sinners, he prays for you and me.   Forgive them, Father, O forgive!   They know not that by me they live!    2 Jesus descended from above   Our loss of Eden to retrieve;   Great God of universal love,   If all the world through thee may live,   In me a quickening Spirit be   And witness thou hast died for me!    3 Thou loving, all-atoning Lamb!   TheeÃÂby thy painful agony,   Thy sweat of blood, thy grief and shame,   Thy cross and passion on the tree,   Thy precious death and lifeÃÂI pray,   Take all, take all my sins away.    4 O let me kiss thy bleeding feet,   And bathe and wash them with my tears;   The story of thy love repeat   In every drooping sinner's ears,   That all may hear the quickening sound,   Since I, even I, have mercy found.    5 O let thy love my heart constrain,   Thy love for every sinner free;   That every fallen soul of man   May taste the grace that found out me,   That all mankind with me may prove   Thy sovereign, everlasting love!

1 I met the good shepherd   Just now on the plain,   As homeward he carried   His lost one again;   I marvelled how gently   His burden he bore,   And as he passed by me   I knelt to adore.    2 O Shepherd, good shepherd,   Thy wounds they are deep;   The wolves have sore hurt thee   In saving thy sheep.   Thy raiment all over   With crimson is dyed;   And what is this wound   They have made in thy side?    3 O Shepherd, good shepherd,   And is it for me   This grievous affliction   Has fallen on thee?   Thy wounds make me love thee,   My heart shall be thine;   With thee I will journey,   My shepherd divine.       Source: The Song Book of the Salvation Army # 111

HYMN 175
1 Weep not Him who onward bears   His cross to Calvary;   He does not ask man's pitying tears,   Who wills for man to die.    2 The awful sorrow of His face,   The bowing of His frame,   Come not from torture of disgrace;   He fears not cross or shame.    3 There is a deeper pang of grief,   An agony unknown,   In which His love finds no relief;   He bears it all alone.    4 He thinks of all for whom His life   Of lowliness and pain,   And weariness and care and strife   Will be, alas, in vain.    5 He sees the souls for whom He dies   Yet clinging to their sin,   And heirs of mansions in the skies   Who will not enter in.    6 Ah! this, my Savior, was the shame   That bowed Thy head so low,   These were the wounds that wracked Thy frame,   And made Thy tears to flow.    7 O may I in Thy sorrow share,   And mourn that sins of mine   Should ever wound with grief or care   That loving heart of Thine.   Amen.   The Hymnal: Published by the authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.,  1895

1 Ah, holy Jesus, how hast thou offended,   that we to judge thee have in hate pretended?   By foes derided, by thine own rejected,   O most afflicted!    2 Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon thee?   Alas, my treason, Jesus, hath undone thee!   'Twas I, Lord Jesus, I it was denied thee;   I crucified thee.    3 Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered;   the slave hath sinned, and the Son hath suffered.   For our atonement, while we nothing heeded,   God interceded.    4 For me, kind Jesus, was thy incarnation,   thy mortal sorrow, and thy life's oblation;   thy death of anguish and thy bitter passion,   for my salvation.    5 Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay thee,   I do adore thee, and will ever pray thee,   think on thy pity and thy love unswerving,   not my deserving.

All the vain things that charm me most,   I sacrifice them through his blood.    3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet,   sorrow and love flow mingled down.   Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,   or thorns compose so rich a crown?    4 Were the whole realm of nature mine,   that were a present far too small.

All, all, is finished now,   all that he left his throne above   to do for us below.    2 No work is left undone   of all the Father willed;   his toil, his sorrows, one by one,   the Scriptures have fulfilled.    3 No pain that we can share   but he has felt its smart;   all forms of human grief and care   have pierced that tender heart.    4 And on his thorn-crowned head   and on his sinless soul   our sins in all their guilt were laid   that he might make us whole.    5 In perfect love he dies;   for me he dies, for me!   O all-atoning Sacrifice,   you died to make me free!    6 In ev'ry time of need,   before the judgment throne,   your works, O Lamb of God, I'll plead,   your merits, not my own.

HYMN 192
1 Ride on, ride on in majesty!   Hear all the tribes hosanna cry;   O Savior meek, pursue Your road   with palms and scattered garments strowed.    2 Ride on, ride on in majesty!   In lowly pomp ride on to die.   O Christ, Your triumphs now begin   o'er captive death and conquered sin.    3 Ride on, ride on in majesty!   The host of angels in the sky   look down with sad and wond'ring eyes   to see th'approaching Sacrifice.    4 Ride on, ride on in majesty!   Your last and fiercest strife is nigh.   The Father on His sapphire throne   awaits His own anointed Son.    5 Ride on, ride on in majesty!   In lowly pomp ride on to die,   bow Your meek head to mortal pain,   then take, O Christ, Your pow'r and reign.       Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 259

HYMN 193
1 Behold the Savior of mankind   Nailed to the shameful tree!   How vast the love that Him inclined   To bleed and die for thee!    2 Hark, how He groans, while nature shakes,   And earth's strong pillars bend!   The temple's veil in sunder breaks;   The solid marbles rend.    3 'Tis done! the precious ransom's paid!   "Receive my soul!" He cries;   See where He bows His sacred head!   He bows His head and dies!    4 But soon He'll break death's envious chain,   And in full glory shine;   O Lamb of God, was ever pain,   Was ever love, like Thine?   Amen.

HYMN 194
1 Go to dark Gethsemane,   You who feel the tempter's pow'r;   Your Redeemer's conflict see;   Watch with Him one bitter hour;   Turn not from His griefs away;   Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.    2 Follow to the judgment hall;   View the Lord of life arraigned;   O the worm-wood and the gall!   O the pangs His soul sustained!   Shun not suff'ring, shame, or loss;   Learn of Him to bear the cross.    3 Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb   There' adoring at His feet,   Mark the miracle of time,   God's own sacrifice complete:   "It is finished!" Hear the cry;   Learn of Jesus Christ to die.    4 Early hasten to the tomb   Where they laid his breathless clay;   All is solitude and gloom;   Who hath taken Him away?   Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes:   Savior, teach us so to rise.   Baptist Hymnal,  1991

HYMN 195
1 He dies, the Friend of sinners dies!   Lo! Salem's daughters weep around.   A solemn darkness veils the skies;   a sudden trembling shakes the ground.    2 Here's love and grief beyond degree:   the Lord of glory dies for men;   but lo, what sudden joys we see!   Jesus, the dead, revives again.    3 The rising God forsakes the tomb!   The tomb in vain forbids His rise:   cherubic legions guard Him home,   And shout Him welcome to the skies.    4 Break off your tears, ye saints, and tell   how high your great Deliv'rer reigns.   Sing how He spoiled the hosts of hell,   and led the monster, Death, in chains.    5 Say: "Live forever, wondrous King,   born to redeem, and strong to save!"   Then ask the monster: "Where's thy sting?   And where's thy vict'ry, boasting grave?"     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 275

HYMN 197
1 Beneath the cross of Jesus   I fain would take my stand,   the shadow of a mighty Rock   within a weary land;   a home within the wilderness,   a rest upon the way,   from the burning of the noontide heat   and the burden of the day.    2 Upon the cross of Jesus   mine eye at times can see   the very dying form of One   who suffered there for me:   and from my stricken heart with tears   two wonders I confess,   the wonders of redeeming love   and my unworthiness.    3 I take, O cross, thy shadow   for my abiding place:   I ask no other sunshine than   the sunshine of his face;   content to let the world go by,   to know no gain nor loss;   my sinful self my only shame,   my glory all the cross.

HYMN 198
1 Never further than Thy cross,   Never higher than Thy feet;   Here earth's precious things seem dross,   Here earth's bitter things grow sweet.    2 Here, O Christ, our sins we see,   Learn Thy love while gazing thus;   Sin, which laid the cross on Thee,   Love, which bore the cross for us.    3 Here we learn to serve and give,   And, rejoicing, self deny;   Here we gather love to live,   Here we gather faith to die.    4 Pressing onward as we can,   Still to this our hearts must tend;   Where our earliest hopes began,   There our last aspirings end;    5 Till amid the hosts of light,   We in Thee redeemed, complete,   Through Thy cross made pure and white,   Cast our crowns before Thy feet.   AMEN.     Source: The A.M.E. Zion Hymnal: official hymnal of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church # 139

1 Jesus, keep me near the cross,   There a precious fountain;   Free to all, a healing stream,   Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.   Refrain:   In the cross, in the cross   Be my glory ever,   Till my ransomed soul shall find   Rest beyond the river.    2 Near the cross, a trembling soul,   Love and mercy found me;   There the Bright and Morning Star   Shed His beams around me.

1 There is a fountain filled with blood   Drawn from Immanuel's veins;   And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,   Lose all their guilty stains:   Lose all their guilty stains,   Lose all their guilty stains;   And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,   Lose all their guilty stains.    2 The dying thief rejoiced to see   That fountain in his day;   And there may I, though vile as he,   Wash all my sins away:   Wash all my sins away,   Wash all my sins away;   And there may I, though vile as he,   Wash all my sins away.    3 Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood   Shall never lose its pow'r,   Till all the ransomed Church of God   Be saved, to sin no more:   Be saved, to sin no more,   Be saved, to sin no more;   Till all the ransomed Church of God   Be saved to sin no more.    4 E'er since by faith I saw the stream   Thy flowing wounds supply,   Redeeming love has been my theme,   And shall be till I die:   And shall be till I die,   And shall be till I die;   Redeeming love has been my theme,   And shall be till I die.    5 When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue   Lies silent in the grave,   Then in a nobler, sweeter song   I'll sing Thy pow'r to save:   I'll sing Thy pow'r to save,   I'll sing Thy pow'r to save;   Then in a nobler, sweeter song   I'll sing Thy pow'r to save.

God will be a sure defense;   this shall be my confidence.    5 Jesus lives! And now is death   but the gate to life immortal;   this shall calm my trembling breath   when I pass its gloomy portal.

1 Ye humble souls, that seek the Lord,   Chase all your fears away;   And bow with rapture down to see   The place where Jesus lay.    2 Thus low the Lord of Life was brought,   Such wonders love can do;   Thus cold in death that bosom lay,   Which throbbed and bled for you.    3 But raise your eyes, and tune your songs,   The Saviour lives again;   Not all the bolts and bars of death   The Conqueror could detain.    4 High o'er the angelic bands He rears   His once dishonoured head;   And through unnumbered years He reigns,   Who dwelt among the dead.    5 With joy like His shall every saint   His vacant tomb survey;   Then rise with his ascending Lord   To realms of endless day.

The foe behind, the deep before,   Our hosts have dared and passed the sea;   And Pharaoh's warriors strew the shore,   And Israel's ransomed tribes are free.   Lift up, lift up your voices now!   The whole wide world rejoices now!   The Lord hath triumphed gloriously!   The Lord shall reign victoriously!   Happy morrow,   Turning sorrow   Into peace and mirth!   Bondage ending,   Love descending   O'er the earth!   Seals assuring,   Guards securing,   Watch His earthly prison:   Seals are shattered,   Guards are scattered,   Christ hath risen!   No longer must the mourners weep,   Nor call departed Christians dead;   For death is hallowed into sleep   And every grave becomes a bed.   Now once more   Eden's door   Open stands to mortan eyes;   For Christ hath risen, and men shall rise,   Now at last,   Old things past,   Hope and joy and peace begin:   For Christ has won, and man shall win.   It is not exile, rest on high;   It is not sadness, peace from strife:   To fall asleep is not to die;   To dwell with Christ is better life.   Where our banner leads us,   We may safely go;   Where our Chief precedes us,   We may face the foe.   His right arm is o'er us,   He will guide us through;   Christ hath gone before us:   Christians, follow you!     Source: Christ in Song # 286

1 The head that once was crowned with thorns   is crowned with glory now;   a royal diadem adorns   the mighty Victor's brow.    2 The highest place that heav'n affords   is His, is His by right,   the King of kings and Lord of lords,   and heav'n's eternal Light.    3 The joy of all who dwell above,   the joy of all below,   to whom He manifests His love,   and grants His name to know.    4 To them the cross with all its shame,   with all its grace, is giv'n,   their name, an everlasting name,   their joy, the joy of heav'n.    5 They suffer with their Lord below,   they reign with Him above,   their profit and their joy to know   the myst'ry of His love.    6 The cross He bore is life and health,   tho' shame and death to Him:   His people's hope, His people's wealth,   their everlasting theme.

1. Hail to the Lord's Anointed,   great David's greater Son!   Hail in the time appointed,   his reign on earth begun!   He comes to break oppression,   to set the captive free;   to take away transgression,   and rule in equity.    2. He comes with succor speedy   to those who suffer wrong;   to help the poor and needy,   and bid the weak be strong;   to give them songs for sighing,   their darkness turn to light,   whose souls, condemned and dying,   are precious in his sight.    3. He shall come down like showers   upon the fruitful earth;   love, joy, and hope, like flowers,   spring in his path to birth.   Before him on the mountains,   shall peace, the herald, go,   and righteousness, in fountains,   from hill to valley flow.    4. To him shall prayer unceasing   and daily vows ascend;   his kingdom still increasing,   a kingdom without end.   The tide of time shall never   his covenant remove;   his name shall stand forever;   that name to us is love.   The United Methodist Hymnal

1 At the name of Jesus   ev'ry knee shall bow,   ev'ry tongue confess him   King of glory now;   'tis the Father's pleasure   we should call him Lord,   who from the beginning   was the mighty Word.    2 At his voice creation   sprang at once to sight,   all the angel faces,   all the hosts of light,   cherubim in heaven,   stars upon their way,   all the heav'nly orders   in their great array.    3 Humbled for a season   to receive a name   from the lips of sinners   unto whom he came,   faithfully he bore it   spotless to the last,   brought it back victorious   when from death he passed;    4 Bore it up triumphant   with its human light,   thro' all ranks of creatures   to the central height,   to the throne of Godhead,   to the Father's breast,   filled it with the glory   of that perfect rest.    5 In your hearts enthrone him;   there let him subdue   all that is not holy,   all that is not true;   crown him as your captain   in temptation's hour;   let his will enfold you   in its light and pow'r.    6 Christians, this Lord Jesus   shall return again   in his Father's glory,   with his angel train;   for all wreaths of empire   meet upon his brow,   and our hearts confess him   King of glory now.

"Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,   earth is with its fullness stored;   unto Thee be glory given,   holy, holy, holy, Lord."    3 With His seraph train before Him,   with His holy church below,   thus conspire we to adore Him,   bid we thus our anthem flow:   "Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,   earth is with its fullness stored;   unto Thee be glory given,   holy, holy, holy, Lord."    4 Thus Thy glorious name confessing,   with Thine angel hosts we cry,   "Holy, holy, holy," blessing   Thee, the Lord of Hosts Most High.

This shall he do, and can we still despair?   Come, let us quickly fling ourselves before him,   cast at his feet the burden of our care. 4 Through life and death, through sorrow and through sinning,   he shall suffice me, for he hath sufficed:   Christ is the end, for Christ was the beginning,   Christ the beginning, for the end is Christ.

Midnight hears the welcome voices,   and at the thrilling cry rejoices:   "Come forth, you maidens! Night is past.   The Bridegroom comes! Awake;   your lamps with gladness take!"   Alleluia!   Prepare yourselves to meet the Lord,   whose light has stirred the waiting guard.    2 Zion hears the watchmen singing,   and in her heart new joy is springing.   She wakes, she rises from her gloom,   for her Lord comes down all-glorious,   and strong in grace, in truth victorious.   Her star is ris'n; her light is come.   O, come, you Blessed One,   Lord Jesus, God's own Son.   Sing hosanna!   We go until the halls we view   where You have bid us dine with You.    3 Now let all the heav'ns adore You,   and saints and angels sing before You.   The harps and cymbals all unite.   Of one pearl each shining portal,   where, dwelling with the choir immortal,   we gather 'round Your dazzling light.   No eye has seen, no ear   has yet been trained to hear   what joy is ours!

1 There's a light upon the mountains,   And the day is at the spring,   When our eyes shall see the beauty   And the glory of the King:   Weary was our heart with waiting,   And the night-watch seemed so long,   But His triumph day is breaking,   And we hail it with a song.    2 In the fading of the starlight   We may see the coming morn;   And the lights of men are paling   In the splendors of the dawn;   For the eastern skies are glowing   As with light of hidden fire,   And the hearts of men are stirring   With the throbs of deep desire.    3 There's a hush of expectation   And a quiet in the air,   And the breath of God is moving   In the fervent breath of prayer;   For the suffering, dying Jesus   Is the Christ upon the throne,   And the travail of our spirit   Is the travail of His own.    4 He is breaking down the barriers,   He is casting up the way;   He is calling for His angels   To build up the gates of day:   But His angels here are human,   Not the shining hosts above;   For the drum beats of His army   Are the heartbeats of our love.    5 Hark! we hear a distant music,   And it comes with fuller swell;   'Tis the triumph-song of Jesus,   Of our King, Immanuel!   Go ye forth with joy to meet Him!   And, my soul, be swift to bring   All thy sweetest and thy dearest   For the triumph of our King!   AMEN.     Source: The A.M.E.

1 Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping:   When shall earth Thy rule obey?   When shall end the night of weeping?   When shall break the promised day?   See the whitening harvest languish,   Waiting still the laborers' toil;   Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish?   Shall the Strong retain the spoil?    2 Tidings, sent to every creature,   Millions yet have never heard:   Can they hear without a preacher?   Lord almighty, give the word!   Give the word! in every nation   Let the gospel trumpet sound,   Witnessing a world's salvation,   To the earth's remotest bound.    3 Then the end! Thy Church completed,   All Thy chosen gathered in,   With their King in glory seated,   Satan bound, and banished sin;   Gone for ever parting, weeping,   Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain;   Lo! her watch Thy Church is keeping;   Come, Lord Jesus, come to reign!   Amen.   The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord  1892

1 Crown him with many crowns,   the Lamb upon his throne.   Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns   all music but its own.   Awake, my soul, and sing   of him who died for thee,   and hail him as thy matchless king   through all eternity.    2 Crown him the Lord of life,   who triumphed o'er the grave,   and rose victorious in the strife   for those he came to save;   his glories now we sing   who died and rose on high,   who died eternal life to bring,   and lives that death may die.    3 Crown him the Lord of love;   behold his hands and side,   rich wounds, yet visible above,   in beauty glorified;   no angels in the sky   can fully bear that sight,   but downward bends their burning eye   at mysteries so bright.    4 Crown him the Lord of years,   the potentate of time,   creator of the rolling spheres,   ineffably sublime.   All hail, Redeemer, hail!   for thou hast died for me;   thy praise shall never, never fail   throughout eternity.   Worship and Rejoice,  2003

1 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun   does its successive journeys run,   his kingdom stretch from shore to shore,   till moons shall wax and wane no more.    2 To him shall endless prayer be made,   and praises throng to crown his head.   His name like sweet perfume shall rise   with every morning sacrifice.    3 People and realms of every tongue   dwell on his love with sweetest song,   and infant voices shall proclaim   their early blessings on his name.    4 Blessings abound where'er he reigns:   the prisoners leap to lose their chains,   the weary find eternal rest,   and all who suffer want are blest.    5 Let every creature rise and bring   the highest honors to our King,   angels descend with songs again,   and earth repeat the loud amen.

1 When God of old came down from heaven,   in power and wrath he came;   before his feet the clouds were riven,   half darkness and half flame:    2 but, when he came the second time,   he came in power and love;   softer than gale at morning prime   hovered his Holy Dove.    3 The fires, that rushed on Sinai down   in sudden torrents dread,   now gently light, a glorious crown,   on every sainted head.    4 And as on Israel's awe-struck ear   the voice exceeding loud,   the trump, that angels quake to hear,   thrilled from the deep, dark cloud;    5 so, when the Spirit of our God   came down his flock to find,   a voice from heaven was heard abroad,   a rushing, mighty wind.    6 It fills the church of God; it fills   the sinful world around;   only in stubborn hearts and wills   no place for it is found.    7 Come Lord, come wisdom, love, and power,   open our ears to hear;   let us not miss the accepted hour;   save, Lord, by love or fear.

And visit a sorrowful breast,   My burden of guilt to remove,   And bring me assurance and rest:   Thou only hast power to relieve   A sinner o'erwhelmed with his load,   The sense of acceptance to give,   And sprinkle his heart with the blood.    2 If, when I have put thee to grief,   And madly to folly returned,   Thy pity has been my relief,   And lifted me up as I mourned,   Most pitiful Spirit of grace   Relieve me again and restore;   My spirit in holiness raise,   To fall and to suffer no more.    3 If now I lament after God,   And pant for a taste of his love,   If Jesus hath bought thee with blood,   For me to receive from above,   Come, heavenly Comforter, come,   True witness of mercy divine!   And make me thy permanent home,   And seal me eternally thine.       Source: The Voice of Praise: a collection of hymns for the use of the Methodist Church # 262

1 Spirit blest, who art adored,   With the Father and the Word,   One Eternal God and Lord:   Hear us Holy Spirit.    2 Comforter, to whom we owe   All that we rejoice to know   Of our Saviour's work below:   Hear us Holy Spirit.    3 Spirit, showing us the way,   Warning when we go astray,   Pleading in us when we pray:   Hear us Holy Spirit.    4 Spirit, whom our failings grieve,   Whom the world will not receive,   Who dost help us to believe:   Hear us Holy Spirit.    5 Spirit, aiding all who yearn   More of truth Divine to learn,   And with deeper love to burn:   Hear us Holy Spirit.    6 Holy, Loving, as thou art,   Come and live within our heart,   Never from us to depart:   Hear us Holy Spirit.    7 May we soon from sin set free,   Where Thy work may perfect be,   Jesus' face with rapture see:   Hear us Holy Spirit.

HYMN 296
1. Holy Spirit! pity me,   Pierced with grief for grieving Thee;   Present, though I mourn apart,   Listen to a wailing heart.    2. Sins unnumbered I confess,   Of exceeding sinfulness,   Sins against Thyself alone,   Only to Omniscience known.    3. Deafness to Thy whispered calls,   Rashness 'midst remembered falls,   Transient fears beneath the rod,   Treacherous trifling with my God.    4. Tasting that the Lord is good,   Pining then for poisoned food;   At the fountains of the skies   Craving creaturely supplies!    5. Worldly cares at worship time:   Groveling aims in works sublime;   Pride, when God is passing by!   Sloth, when souls in darkness die!    6. Chilled devotions, changed desires,   Quenched corruption's earlier fires:   Sins like these my heart deceive,   Thee, who only know'st them, grieve.    7. O how lightly I have slept,   With Thy daily wrongs unwept!   Sought Thy chiding to defer,   Shunned the wounded Comforter.    8. Woke to holy labors fresh,   With the plague-spot in my flesh;   Angel seemed to human sight,   Stood a leper in Thy light!    9. Still Thy comforts do not fail,   Still Thy healing aids avail;   Patient Inmate of my breast,   Thou art grieved, yet I am blest.    10. O be merciful to me,   Now in bitterness for Thee!   Father, pardon through Thy Son   Sins against Thy Spirit done!     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 2516

1 Before Jehovah's aweful throne,   ye nations, bow with sacred joy;   know that the Lord is God alone:   he can create, and he destroy. 2 His sovereign power, without our aid,   made us of clay, and formed us then;   and, when like wandering sheep we strayed,   he brought us to his fold again. 3 We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,   high as the heavens our voices raise;   and earth, with her ten thousand tongues,   shall fill thy courts with sounding praise. 4 Wide as the world is thy command,   vast as eternity thy love;   firm as a rock thy truth must stand,   when rolling years shall cease to move.

1 LORD of all being, throned afar,   Thy glory flames from sun and star;   Centre and soul of every sphere,   Yet to each loving heart how near. 2 Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray   Sheds on our path the glow of day;   Star of our hope, Thy softened light   Cheers the long watches of the night. 3 Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;   Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;   Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy's sign;   All save the clouds of sin, are Thine. 4 Lord of all life, below, above,   Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,   Before Thy ever-blazing throne   We ask no lustre of our own. 5 Grant us Thy truth to make us free,   And kindling hearts that burn for Thee,   Till all Thy living altars claim   One holy light, one heavenly flame.

1 Art thou weary, art thou languid,   art thou sore distrest?   'Come to me,' saith One, 'and coming,   be at rest!"    2 Hath he marks to lead me to him,   if he be my guide?   In his feet and hands are wound-prints,   and his side.    3 Hath he diadem as monarch   that his brow adorns?   Yea, a crown, in very surety,   but of thorns.    4 If I find him, if I follow,   what his guerdon here?   Many a sorrow, many a labour,   many a tear.    5 If I still hold closely to him,   what has he at last?   Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,   Jordan past.    6 If I ask him to receive me,   will he say me nay?   Not till earth, and not till heaven   pass away.    7 Finding, following, keeping, struggling,   is he sure to bless?   Angels, martyrs, prophets, virgins,   answer, yes!

Why, ye ransomed sinners, why   Will you slight His grace and die?    4 Sinners, turn: why will ye die?

It tells of benediction,   of pardon, grace, and peace,   of joy that hath no ending,   of love which cannot cease.    2 "Come unto me, dear wand'rers,   and I will give you light."   O loving voice of Jesus,   which comes to cheer the night!   Our hearts were filled with sadness,   and we had lost our way,   but thou hast brought us gladness   and songs at break of day.    3 "Come unto me, ye fainting,   and I will give you life."

But the Shepherd made answer: "This of mine   Has wandered away from me;   And although the road be rough and steep,   I go to the desert to find my sheep,   I go to the desert to find my sheep."    3 But none of the ransomed ever knew   How deep were the waters crossed;   Nor how dark was the night the Lord passed thro'   Ere He found His sheep that was lost.   Out in the desert He heard its cryÃÂ   So sick and helpless and ready to die;   So sick and helpless and ready to die.    4 "Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way   That mark out the mountain's track?"   "They were shed for one who had gone astray   Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."   "Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"

HYMN 343
1 Wherewith, O Lord, shall I draw near,   Or bow myself before thy face?   How in thy purer eyes appear?   What shall I bring to gain thy grace?    2 Will gifts delight the Lord most high?   Will multiply'd oblations please?   Thousands of rams his favor buy,   Or slaughter'd hecatombs appease?    3 Can these assuage the wrath of God?   Can these wash out my guilty stain?   Rives of oil, or seas of blood,   Alas! they all must flow in vain.    4 Guilty, I stand before thy face;   My sole desert is hell and wrath;   'Twere just the sentence should take place;   But Oh, I plead my Saviour's death!    5 I plead the merits of thy son   Who dy'd for sinners on the tree;   I plead his righteousness alone,   O put the spotless robe on me.

1 Jesus, the sinner's Friend, to Thee,   Lost and undone, for aid I flee,   Weary of earth, myself, and sin;   Open Thine arms, and take me in.    2 Pity and heal my sin-sick soul;   'Tis Thou alone canst make me whole;   Dark, till in me Thine image shine,   And lost, I am, till Thou art mine.    3 At last I own it cannot be   That I should fit myself for Thee:   Here, then, to Thee I all resign;   Thine is the work, and only Thine.    4 What shall I say Thy grace to move?   Lord, I am sin, but Thou art love:   I give up every plea beside-   Lord, I am lost, but Thou hast died.   AMEN.     Source: The A.M.E.

Stone to flesh, O God, convert;   Cast a look, and break my heart!    2.

Jesu, seek Thy wandering sheep,   Make me restless to return;   Bid me look on Thee, and weep,   Bitterly as Peter mourn,   Till I say, by grace restored,   Now Thou know'st I love Thee, Lord    4. Might I in Thy sight appear,   As the publican distressed,   Stand, not daring to draw near,   Smite on my unworthy breast,   Groan the sinner's only plea,   God, be merciful to me!    5.

1 Lord Jesus, if the same you are,   if all your promises are sure,   set up your kingdom in my heart   and make me rich, for I am poor;   to me be all your treasure given,   the kingdom of an inward heaven.    2 You have pronounced the mourners blest;   for loss of you I ever mourn:   I cannot, and I will not rest   till you, my only rest, return;   till you, the Prince of Peace, appear,   and I receive the Comforter.    3 Where is the blessedness bestowed   on all that hunger after you?   I hunger now, I thirst for God:   now this poor sinner's life renew,   and satisfy with endless peace,   and fill me with your righteousness.    4 Shine on your work, disperse the gloom,   light in your light I'll see anew:   say to my soul, 'Your light is come,   glory divine is risen on you,   your warfare's done, your mourning's past;   look up, your tears shall end at last!'

1 With broken heart and contrite sigh   A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry:   Thy pardoning grace is rich and free   O God, be merciful to me.    2 I smite upon my troubled breast,   With deep and conscience guilt oppressed;   Christ and His cross my only plea:   O God, be merciful to me.    3 Far off I stand with tearful eyes,   Nor dare uplift them to the skies;   But Thou dost all my anguish see:   O God, be merciful to me.    4 Nor alms, nor deeds that I have done,   Can for a single sin atone;   To Calvary alone I flee:   O God, be merciful to me.    5 And when, redeemed from sin and hell,   With all the ransomed throng I dwell,   My raptured song shall ever be,   God has been merciful to me.

Before the whiteness of that throne appear?   Yet there are hands stretched out to draw me near.    3 The while I fain would tread the heav'nly way,   evil is ever with me day by day;   yet on my ears the gracious tidings fall,   "Repent, confess, thou shalt be loosed from all."    4 It is the voice of Jesus that I hear;   his are the hands stretched out to draw me near,   and his the blood that can for all atone   and set me faultless there before the throne.    5 O great Absolver, grant my soul may wear   the lowliest garb of penitence and pray'r,   that in the Father's courts my glorious dress   may be the garment of thy righteousness.    6 Yea, thou wilt answer for me, righteous Lord;   thine all the merits, mine the great reward;   thine the sharp thorns, and mine the golden crown;   mine the life won, and thine the life laid down.

If Thou remember each misdeed,   If each should have its rightful meed,   Who may abide Thy presence?    2 Our pardon is Thy gift; Thy love   And grace alone avail us.   Our works could ne'er our guilt remove,   The strictest life would fail us.   That none may boast himself of aught,   But own in fear Thy grace hath wrought   What in him seemeth righteous.    3 And thus, my hope is in the Lord,   And not in mine own merit;   I rest upon His faithful word   To them of contrite spirit.   That He is merciful and just,--   This is my comfort and my trust,   His help I wait with patience.    4 And though it tarry till the night   And round till morning waken,   My heart shall ne'er mistrust Thy might,   Nor count itself forsaken.   Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,   Ye of the Spirit born indeed,   Wait for your God's appearing.    5 Though great our sins and sore our woes,   His grace much more aboundeth;   His helping love no limit knows,   Our utmost need it soundeth;   Our kind and faithful Shepherd He,   Who shall at last set Israel free   From all their sin and sorrow.

Where shall my wondering soul begin?   How shall I all to heaven aspire?   A slave redeemed from death and sin,   a brand plucked from eternal fire,   how shall I equal triumphs raise,   or sing my great deliverer's praise?   O how shall I the goodness tell,   Father, which thou to me hast showed?   That I, a child of wrath and hell,   I should be called a child of God!   Should know, should feel my sins forgiven,   blest with this antepast of heaven!   And shall I slight my Father's love,   or basely fear his gifts to own?   Unmindful of his favors prove,   shall I, the hallowed cross to shun,   refuse his righteousness to impart,   by hiding it within my heart?   Outcasts of men, to you I call,   harlots, and publicans, and thieves;   he spreads his arms to embrace you all,   sinners alone his grace receive.   No need of Him the righteous have;   he came the lost to seek and save.   Come, O my guilty brethren, come,   groaning beneath your load of sin;   his bleeding heart shall make you room,   his open side shall take you in.   He calls you now, invites you home:   Come, O my guilty brethren, come.

1. Day after day I sought the Lord,   And waited patiently;   Until He bent down from His throne,   And hearkened to my cry.    2. He drew me from the fearful pit,   And from the miry clay;   He placed my feet upon a rock,   And led me in His way.    3. He taught my soul a new-made song,   A song of holy praise,   All they who see these things, with fear   Their hopes to God shall raise.    4. Most blessÃÂ¨d is the man whose hope   Upon the Lord relies;   Who follows not the proud, nor those   That turn aside to lies.    5. O Lord, what wonders hast Thou wrought,   All number far above!   Thy thoughts to us-ward overflow   With mercy, grace, and love.    6. Show forth Thy mercy, gracious Lord;   O take it not away!   Thy loving kindness and Thy truth,   Let them be still my stay.    7. For countless sorrows hem me round;   And my iniquities   So hold me fast, and drag me down,   I cannot raise my eyes.    8. My hairs in number they surpass;   Hence is my heart dismayed;   Vouchsafe, O Lord, to rescue me!   O hasten to my aid.    9. Let those who seek Thee faithfully   In peace and joy abide;   Let those who love Thy grace still say,   The Lord be magnified.    10. Poor am I, and in need; yet God   Care of my soul doth take.

Before the throne my Surety stands,   before the throne my Surety stands;   my name is written on His hands.    2 He ever lives above,   for me to intercede;   His all-redeeming love,   His precious blood to plead,   His blood atoned for all our race,   His blood atoned for all our race,   and sprinkles now the throne of grace.    3 Five bleeding wounds He bears,   received on Calvary;   they pour effectual prayers,   they strongly plead for me.   "Forgive him, O, forgive," they cry,   "Forgive him, O, forgive," they cry,   "Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"    4 The Father hears Him pray,   His dear Anointed One;   He cannot turn away   the presence of His Son.   His Spirit answers to the blood,   His Spirit answers to the blood,   and tells me I am born of God.    5 My God is reconciled,   His pard'ning voice I hear;   He owns me for a child,   I can no longer fear.   With confidence I now draw nigh,   with confidence I now draw nigh,   and, "Father, Abba, Father," cry.     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 313

1 Hail! Holy, Holy, Holy Lord,   Whom One in Three we know;   By all Thy heavenly hosts adored,   By all Thy Church below.    2 One undivided Trinity   With triumph we proclaim;   Thy universe is full of Thee,   And speaks Thy glorious Name.    3 Thee, Holy Father, we confess,   Thee, Holy Son, adore;   And Thee, the Holy Ghost, we bless   And worship evermore.    4 Hail!

1 Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness   my beauty are, my glorious dress;   'midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,   with joy shall I lift up my head.    2 Bold shall I stand in Thy great day,   for who aught to my charge shall lay?   Fully absolved through these I am,   from sin and fear, from guilt and shame.    3 Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,   which at the mercy seat of God,   forever doth for sinners plead,   for me, e'en for my soul, was shed.    4 Jesus, be endless praise to Thee,   whose boundless mercy hath for me,   for me a full atonement made,   an everlasting ransom paid.    5 When from the dust of death I rise   to claim my mansion in the skies,   e'en then this shall be all my plea,   Jesus hath lived, hath died, for me.    6 O let the dead now hear Thy voice;   now bid Thy ransomed ones rejoice;   their beauty this, their glorious dress,   Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness.

1 And can it be that I should gain   An int'rest in the Savior's blood?   Died He for me, who caused His pain?   For me, who Him to death pursued?   Amazing love! how can it be   That Thou, my God, should die for me?   Refrain:   Amazing love! how can it be   That Thou, my God, should die for me!    2 'Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!

[Refrain]    3 He left His Father's throne above,   So free, so infinite His grace;   Emptied Himself of all but love,   And bled for Adam's helpless race;   'Tis mercy all, immense and free;   For, O my God, it found out me. [Refrain]    4 Long my imprisoned spirit lay   Fast bound in sin and nature's night;   Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,   I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;   My chains fell off, my heart was free;   I rose, went forth and followed Thee. [Refrain]    5 No condemnation now I dread;   Jesus, and all in Him is mine!   Alive in Him, my living Head,   And clothed in righteousness divine,   Bold I approach th'eternal throne,   And claim the crown, through Christ my own. [Refrain]   Amen.   Sing Joyfully,  1989

1 Now I have found the ground wherein   Sure my soul's anchor may remain--   The wounds of Jesus, for my sin   Before the world's foundation slain;   Whose mercy shall unshaken stay,   When heav'n and earth are fled away.    2 Father, Thine everlasting grace   Our scanty thought surpasses far,   Thy heart still melts with tenderness,   Thy arms of love still open are,   Returning sinners to receive,   That mercy they may taste and live.    3 O Love, Thou bottomless abyss,   My sins are swallowed up in thee!   Covered is my unrighteousness,   Nor spot of guilt remains on me,   While Jesus' blood, through earth and skies   Mercy, free, boundless mercy! cries.    4 With faith I plunge me in this sea,   Here is my hope, my joy, my rest;   Hither, when hell assails, I flee,   I look into my Savior's breast.   Away, sad doubt and anxious fear!   Mercy is all that's written there.    5 Though waves and storms go o'er my head,   Though strength, and health, and friends be gone,   Though joys be withered all and dead,   Though every comfort be withdrawn,   On this my steadfast soul relies--   Father, Thy mercy never dies!    6 Fixed on this ground will I remain,   Though my heart fail and flesh decay;   This anchor shall my soul sustain,   When earth's foundations melt away.

And should I not with faith draw nigh,   And boldly, Abba, Father, cry,   I know myself Thy child?    5 Ah! never let Thy servant rest,   Till, of my part in Christ possessed,   I on Thy mercy feed:   Unworthy of the crumbs that fall,   Yet raised by Him who died for all,   To eat the children's bread.    6 Whate'er obstructs Thy pardoning love,   Or sin, or righteousness, remove,   Thy glory to display;   My heart of unbelief convince,   And now absolve me from my sins,   And take them all away.

1 I will sing the wondrous story   Of the Christ who died for me.   How He left His home in glory   For the cross of Calvary.   I was lost, but Jesus found me,   Found the sheep that went astray,   Threw His loving arms around me,   Drew me back into His way.    2 I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;   Faint was I from many a fall;   Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,   But He freed me from them all.   Days of darkness still come o'er me,   Sorrow's paths I often tread,   But the Savior still is with me;   By His hand I'm safely led.    3 He will keep me till the river   Rolls its waters at my feet;   Then He'll bear me safely over,   Where the loved ones I shall meet.   Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story   Of the Christ who died for me,   Sing it with the saints in glory,   Gathered by the crystal sea.   Baptist Hymnal,  1991

With eager feet I would appear   among your saints, to seek your face;   for I have seen your glory there,   and felt the power of sovereign grace.   Amid the wakeful hours of night,   when busy cares afflict my head,   one thought of you gives new delight,   and adds great comfort to my bed.

1 Thy life was given for me,   thy blood, O Lord, was shed,   that I might ransomed be,   and quickened from the dead;   thy life was given for me;   what have I given for thee?    2 Long years were spent for me   in weariness and woe,   that through eternity   thy glory I might know;   long years were spent for me;   have I spent one for thee?    3 Thy Father's home of light,   thy rainbow-circled throne,   were left for earthly night,   for wanderings sad and lone;   yea, all was left me;   have I left aught for thee?    4 Thou, Lord, hast borne for me   more than my tongue can tell   of bitterest agony,   to rescue me from hell;   thou sufferedst all for me;   what have I borne for thee?    5 And thou hast brought to me   down from thy home above   salvation full and free,   thy pardon and thy love;   great gifts thou broughtest me;   what have I brought to thee?    6 O let my life be given   my years for thee be spent;   world-fetters all be riven,   and joy with suff'ring blent:   thou gavest thyself for me,   I give myself to thee.

1 I give my heart to Thee,   O Jesus most desired;   And heart for heart the gift shall be,   For Thou my soul has fired:    2 Thou hearts alone wouldst move,   Thou only hearts dost love;   I would love Thee, as Thou lovÂst me,   O Jesus most desired.    3 What offÂring can I make,   Dear Lord, to love like ThineÂ   That Thou, the Word, didst stoop to take   A human form like mine?    4 ÂGive me thy heart, My son:Â   Lord, Thou my heart has won;   I would love Thee as Thou lovÂst me,   O Jesus most desired.    5 Thy heart is opened wide,   Its offered love most free,   That heart to heart I may abide,   And hide myself in Thee:    6 Ah, how Thy love doth burn,   Till I that love return!

O not for Thee my fading fires,   The ashes of my heart!    5 Accept me in my golden time,   In my dear joys have part!

1 Lord of life and King of glory,   Who didst deign a child to be,   Cradled on a motherÂs bosom,   Throned upon a motherÂs knee:   For the children Thou hast given   We must answer unto Thee.    2 Grant us then pure hearts and patient,   That in all we do or say   Little souls our deeds may copy,   And be never led astray;   Little feet our steps may follow   In a safe and narrow way.    3 When our growing sons and daughters   Look on life with eager eyes,   Grant us then a deeper insight   And new pow'rs of sacrifice:   Hope to trust them, faith to guide them,   Love that nothing good denies.    4 May we keep our holy calling   Stainless in its fair renown,   That, when all the work is over   And we lay the burdens down,   Then the children Thou hast given   Still may be our joy and crown.

1 Before Jehovah's aweful throne,   ye nations, bow with sacred joy;   know that the Lord is God alone:   he can create, and he destroy. 2 His sovereign power, without our aid,   made us of clay, and formed us then;   and, when like wandering sheep we strayed,   he brought us to his fold again. 3 We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,   high as the heavens our voices raise;   and earth, with her ten thousand tongues,   shall fill thy courts with sounding praise. 4 Wide as the world is thy command,   vast as eternity thy love;   firm as a rock thy truth must stand,   when rolling years shall cease to move.

Take my moments and my days;   let them flow in endless praise,   let them flow in endless praise.    2 Take my hands and let them move   at the impulse of thy love.   Take my feet and let them be   swift and beautiful for thee,   swift and beautiful for thee.    3 Take my voice and let me sing   always, only, for my King.   Take my lips and let them be   filled with messages from thee,   filled with messages from thee.    4 Take my silver and my gold;   not a mite would I withhold.   Take my intellect and use   every power as thou shalt choose,   every power as thou shalt choose.    5 Take my will and make it thine;   it shall be no longer mine.   Take my heart it is thine own;   it shall be thy royal throne,   it shall be thy royal throne.    6 Take my love; my Lord, I pour   at thy feet its treasure store.

We sing Thine arm unshortened,   Brought through our sore temptation;   With heart and voice in Thee rejoice,   The God of our salvation.    3 Thine arm hath safely brought us   A way no more expected,   Than when Thy sheep passed through the deep,   By crystal walls protected.

1 Worship, and thanks, and blessing,   And strength ascribe to Jesus!   Jesus alone defends His own,   When earth and hell oppress us.   Jesus with joy we witness   Almighty to deliver;   Our seals set to, that God is true,   And reigns a King for ever.    2 Omnipotent Redeemer,   Our ransomed souls adore Thee;   Our Saviour Thou, we find it now,   And give Thee all the glory.   We sing Thine arm unshortened,   Brought through our sore temptation;   With heart and voice in Thee rejoice,   The God of our salvation.    3 Thine arm hath safely brought us   A way no more expected,   Than when Thy sheep passed through the deep,   By crystal walls protected.   Thy glory was our rear-ward,   Thy hand our lives did cover,   And we, even we, have passed the sea,   And marched triumphant over.    4 The world's and Satan's malice   Thou, Jesus, hast confounded;   And, by Thy grace, with songs of praise   Our happy souls resounded.   Accepting our deliverance,   We triumph in Thy favour,   And for the love which now we prove,   Shall praise Thy name for ever.

1 When all your mercies, O my God,   my waking soul surveys,   transported with the view, I'm lost   in wonder, love, and praise.    2 Ten thousand thousand precious gifts   my daily thanks employ,   nor is the least a cheerful heart   that tastes these gifts with joy.    3 Through ev'ry passing phase of life   your goodness I'll pursue   and after death, in distant worlds,   the glorious theme renew.    4 Through all eternity to you   a joyful song I'll raise,   but, oh, eternity's too short   to utter all your praise.

1 We thank Thee, Lord, for this fair earth,   The glittering sky, the silver sea;   For all their beauty, all their worth,   Their light and glory, come from Thee.    2 Thine are the flowers that clothe the ground,   The trees that wave their arms above,   The hills that gird our dwellings round,   As Thou dost gird thine own with love.    3 Yet teach us still how far more fair,   More glorious, Father, in Thy sight,   Is one pure deed, one holy prayer,   One heart that owns Thy SpiritÂs might.    4 So while we gaze with thoughtful eye   On all the gifts Thy love has given,   Help us in Thee to live and die,   By Thee to rise from earth to heaven.

1 Sing praise to God who reigns above,   the God of all creation,   the God of power, the God of love,   the God of our salvation.   With healing balm my soul is filled   and every faithless murmur stilled:   To God all praise and glory.    2 The Lord is never far away,   but through all grief distressing,   an ever present help and stay,   our peace and joy and blessing.   As with a mother's tender hand,   God gently leads the chosen band:   To God all praise and glory.    3 Thus all my toilsome way along,   I sing aloud thy praises,   that earth may hear the grateful song   my voice unwearied raises.   Be joyful in the Lord, my heart,   both soul and body bear your part:   To God all praise and glory.    4 Let all who name Christ's holy name   give God all praise and glory;   let all who own his power proclaim   aloud the wondrous story!   Cast each false idol from its throne,   for Christ is Lord, and Christ alone:   To God all praise and glory.   United Methodist Hymnal,  1989

1 Come, thou Fount of every blessing;   tune my heart to sing thy grace;   streams of mercy, never ceasing,   call for songs of loudest praise.   Teach me some melodious sonnet,   sung by flaming tongues above;   praise the mount! IÂm fixed upon it,   mount of GodÂs unchanging love!    2 Here I raise my Ebenezer;   hither by thy help IÂm come;   and I hope, by thy good pleasure,   safely to arrive at home.   Jesus sought me when a stranger,   wandering from the fold of God;   he, to rescue me from danger,   interposed his precious blood.    3 O to grace how great a debtor   daily IÂm constrained to be!   Let that grace now, like a fetter,   bind my wandering heart to thee.   Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,   prone to leave the God I love;   hereÂs my heart; O take and seal it;   seal it for thy courts above.   Glory to God: the Presbyterian Hymnal ( 2003)

1 My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;   for thee all the follies of sin I resign;   my gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou;   if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.    2 I love thee because thou hast first loved me   and purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;   I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;   if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.    3 I'll love thee in life, I will love thee in death,   and praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath,   and say when the deathdew lies cold on my brow:   If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.    4 In mansions of glory and endless delight,   I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;   I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow:   If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

1 THE spacious firmament on high,   With all the blue ethereal sky,   And spangled heavens, a shining frame,   Their great Original proclaim. 2 Th'unwearied sun, from day to day,   Doth his Creator's power display;   And publishes to every land   The work of an almighty hand. 3 Soon as the evening shades prevail,   The moon takes up the wondrous tale,   And nightly to the listening earth   Repeats the story of her birth: 4 While all the stars that round her burn,   And all the planets in their turn,   Confirm the tidings as they roll,   And spread the truth from pole to pole. 5 What though in solemn silence all   Move round this dark terrestrial ball;   What though no real voice nor sound   Amidst their radiant orbs be found: 6 In reason's ear they all rejoice,   And utter forth a glorious voice,   For ever singing as they shine:   The hand that made us is divine!

1 Happy the heart where graces reign,   Where love inspires the breast;   Love is the brightest of the train,   And strengthens all the rest.    2 Knowledge, alas! 'tis all in vain,   And all in vain our fear;   Our stubborn sins will fight and reign,   If love be absent there.    3 'Tis love that makes our cheerful feet   In swift obedience move;   The devils know, and tremble too;   But devils do not love.    4 This is the grace that lives and sings   When faith and hope shall cease;   'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings   In the sweet, realms of bliss.

HYMN 443
1 Loved with everlasting love,   drawn by grace that love to know,   Spirit sent from Christ above,   thou dost witness it is so.   O this full and precious peace   from his presence all divine;   in a love that cannot cease,   I am his and he is mine.    2 Heav'n above is deeper blue,   earth around is sweeter green,   that which glows in ev'ry hue   Christless eyes have never seen.   Birds in song his glories show,   flow'rs with richer beauties shine   since I know, as now I know,   I am his and he is mine.    3 Taste the goodness of the Lord:   welcomed home to his embrace,   all his love, as blood outpoured,   seals the pardon of his grace.   Can I doubt his love for me,   when I trace that love's design?   By the cross of Calvary   I am his and he is mine.    4 His forever, only his--   who the Lord and me shall part?   Ah, with what a rest of bliss   Christ can fill the loving heart.   Heav'n and earth may fade and flee,   firstborn light in gloom decline,   but while God and I shall be,   I am his and he is mine.     Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal # 483

1 My God, I love Thee, not because   I hope for heav'n thereby,   nor yet for fear that, loving not,   I might forever die.   But for that Thou didst all mankind   upon the cross embrace;   for us didst bear the nails and spear,   and manifold disgrace;    2 And griefs and torments numberless,   and sweat of agony,   e'en death itself, and all for man,   who was Thine enemy.   Then why, most loving Jesus Christ,   should I not love Thee well?   Not for the sake of winning heav'n,   nor any fear of hell;    3 Not with the hope of gaining aught,   nor seeking a reward,   but as Thyself hast loved me,   O ever-loving Lord!   E'en so I love Thee, and will love,   and in Thy praise will sing,   solely because Thou art my God,   and my eternal King!     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 336

I know but half His love,   But half discern Him, and but half adore;   But when I meet Him in the realms above,   I hope to love Him better, praise Him more,   And feel, and tell, amid the choir divine,   How fully I am His, and He is mine.

HYMN 465
1 Open, Lord, my inward ear,   and bid my heart rejoice!   Bid my quiet spirit hear   thy comfortable voice,   never in the whirlwind found,   or where earthquakes rock the place;   still and silent is the sound,   the whisper of thy grace.    2 From the world of sin and noise   and hurry I withdraw.   For the small and inward voice   I wait, with humble awe.   Silent am I now and still,   dare not in thy presence move.   To my waiting soul reveal   the secret of thy love.    3 Thou hast undertook for me,   for me to death wast sold;   wisdom in a mystery   of bleeding love unfold.   Teach the lesson of the cross;   let me die with thee to reign.   All things let me count but loss   so I may thee regain.    4 Lord, my time is in thy handÂ   my soul to thee convert.   Thou canst make me understand,   though I am slow of heart.   Thine, in whom I love and move,   thine the work, the praise is thine,   thou art wisdom, powÂr, and love,   and all thou art is mine.     Source: Voices Together # 548

1 My soul, there is a country   far beyond the stars,   where stands a wingÃ¨d sentry   all skilful in the wars. 2 There, above noise and danger,   sweet peace sits crowned with smiles,   and One born in a manger   commands the beauteous files. 3 He is thy gracious Friend,   and Â O my soul, awake! Â   did in pure love descend,   to die here for thy sake. 4 If thou canst get but thither,   there grows the flower of peace,   the rose that cannot wither,   thy fortress and thy ease. 5 Leave then thy foolish ranges,   for none can thee secure   but one who never changes,   thy God, thy life, thy cure.

1 My spirit longs for thee   within my troubled breast,   though I unworthy be   of so divine a guest. 2 Of so divine a guest   unworthy though I be,   yet has my heart no rest   unless it come from thee. 3 Unless it come from thee,   in vain I look around;   in all that I can see   no rest is to be found. 4 No rest is to be found   but in thy blessed love:   O let my wish be crowned,   and send it from above!

1 Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,   When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;   Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,   Dawns the sweet consciousness I am with Thee.    2 Alone with Thee amid the mystic shadows,   The solemn hush of nature newly born;   Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,   In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.    3 Still, still with Thee! as to each newborn morning   A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,   So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,   Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.    4 When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,   Its closing eyes look up to Thee in prayer;   Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o'ershading,   But sweeter still, to wake and find Thee there.    5 So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,   When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee;   O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,   Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.

1 Thy ceaseless, unexhausted love,   unmerited and free,   delights our evil to remove,   and help our misery.    2 Thou waitest to be gracious still;   thou dost with sinners bear,   that, saved, we may thy goodness feel,   and all thy grace declare.    3 Thy goodness and thy truth to me,   to ev'ry soul abound,   a vast, unfathomable sea,   where all our thoughts are drowned.    4 Its streams the whole creation reach,   so plenteous is the store,   enough for all, enough for each,   enough for evermore.    5 Faithful, O Lord, thy mercies are,   a rock that cannot move;   a thousand promises declare   thy constancy of love.    6 Throughout the universe it reigns,   unalterably sure;   and while the truth of God remains   the goodness must endure.

1 Fight the good fight with all your might,   Christ is your strength and Christ your right.   Lay hold on life, and it shall be   your joy and crown eternally.    2 Run the straight race through God's good grace;   lift up your eyes, and seek his face.   Life with its way before us lies;   Christ is the path and Christ the prize.    3 Cast care aside, lean on your guide;   his boundless mercy will provide.   Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove   Christ is its life and Christ its love.    4 Faint not, nor fear, his arms are near;   he changes not, and you are dear.   Only believe, and you will see   that Christ is Lord eternally.     Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal # 876

1 A safe stronghold our God is still,   a trusty shield and weapon;   he'll keep us clear from all the ill   that hath us now o'ertaken.   The ancient prince of hell   hath risen with purpose fell;   strong mail of craft and power   he weareth in this hour;   on earth is not his fellow.    2 With force of arms we nothing can,   full soon were we down-ridden;   but for us fights the proper Man   whom God himself hath bidden.   Ask ye, who is this same?   Christ Jesus is his name,   the Lord Sabaoth's Son;   he, and no other one,   shall conquer in the battle.   * 3 And were this world all devils o'er,   and watching to devour us,   we lay it not to heart so sore;   not they can overpower us.   And let the prince of ill   look grim as e'er he will,   he harms us not a whit;   for why? His doom is writ;   a word shall quickly slay him.   * 4 God's word, for all their craft and force,   one moment will not linger,   but, spite of hell, shall have its course;   'tis written by his finger.   And though they take our life,   goods, honour, children, wife,   yet is their profit small;   these things shall vanish all:   the city of God remaineth.     Source: CPWI Hymnal # 213

1 To the hills I lift my eyes,   the everlasting hills.   Streaming forth in fresh supplies,   my soul the Spirit feels;   will he not his help afford?   Help, while yet I ask, is giv'n;   God comes down, the God and Lord   who made both earth and heav'n.    2 Faithful soul, pray, always pray,   and still in God confide;   he your stumbling steps shall stay,   and shall not let you slide;   safe from known or secret roes,   free from sin and Satan's hold,   when the flesh, earth, hell oppose,   he'll keep you in his fold.    3 See the Lord, your keeper, stand   omnipotently near.   Now he holds you by the hand,   and banishes your fear;   shadows with his wings your head,   guards from all impending harms;   round you and beneath are spread   the everlasting arms.    4 Christ shall bless your going out,   shall bless your coming in;   kindly compass you about,   till you are saved from sin.

1 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,   let me hide myself in thee;   let the water and the blood,   from thy wounded side which flowed,   be of sin the double cure;   save from wrath and make me pure.    2 Not the labors of my hands   can fulfill thy law's demands;   could my zeal no respite know,   could my tears forever flow,   all for sin could not atone;   thou must save, and thou alone.    3 Nothing in my hand I bring,   simply to the cross I cling;   naked, come to thee for dress;   helpless, look to thee for grace;   foul, I to the fountain fly;   wash me, Savior, or I die.    4 While I draw this fleeting breath,   when mine eyes shall close in death,   when I soar to worlds unknown,   see thee on thy judgment throne,   Rock of Ages, cleft for me,   let me hide myself in thee.

1 Peace! doubting heart; my God's I am;   Who formed me man, forbids my fear;   The Lord hath called me by my name;   The Lord protects, for ever near;   His blood for me did once atone.   And still He loves and guards His own.    2 When passing through the watery deep,   I ask in faith His promised aid,   The waves an awful distance keep,   And shrink from my devoted head;   Fearless their violence I dare;   They cannot harm, for God is there!    3 To Him mine eye of faith I turn,   And through the fire pursue my way;   The fire forgets its power to burn,   The lambent flames around me play;   I own His power, accept the sign,   And shout to prove the Saviour mine.    4 When darkness intercepts the skies,   And sorrow's waves around me roll,   When high the storms of passion rise,   And half o'erwhelm my sinking soul,   My soul a sudden calm shall feel,   And hear a whisper, "Peace: be still!"    5 Still near me, O my Saviour, stand!   And guard in fierce temptation's hour;   Hide in the hollow of Thy hand;   Show forth in me Thy saving power;   Still be Thy arms my sure defence;   Nor earth nor hell shall pluck me thence.

1 Thy way, not mine, O Lord,   however dark it be;   lead me by thine own hand,   choose out the path for me.    2 Smooth let it be or rough,   it will be still the best;   winding or straight, it leads   right onward to thy rest.    3 I dare not choose my lot;   I would not if I might:   choose thou for me, my God,   so shall I walk aright.    4 The Kingdom that I seek   is thine; so let the way   that leads to it be thine,   else I must surely stray.    5 Take thou my cup, and it   with joy or sorrow fill,   as best to thee may seem;   choose thou my good and ill.    6 Choose thou for me my friends,   my sickness or my health;   choose thou my cares for me,   my poverty or wealth.    7 Not mine, not mine, the choice   in things or great or small;   be thou my guide, my strength,   my wisdom, and my all.

HYMN 516
1 When we walk with the Lord   in the light of his word,   what a glory he sheds on our way!   While we do his good will,   he abides with us still,   and with all who will trust and obey.   Refrain:   Trust and obey, for there's no other way   to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.    2 Not a burden we bear,   not a sorrow we share,   but our toil he doth richly repay;   not a grief or a loss,   not a frown or a cross,   but is blest if we trust and obey. [Refrain]    3 But we never can prove   the delights of his love   until all on the altar we lay;   for the favor he shows,   for the joy he bestows,   are for them who will trust and obey. [Refrain]    4 Then in fellowship sweet   we will sit at his feet,   or we'll walk by his side in the way;   what he says we will do,   where he sends we will go;   never fear, only trust and obey. [Refrain]   United Methodist HymnalM,  1989

HYMN 517
1. Simply trusting every day,   Trusting through a stormy way;   Even when my faith is small,   Trusting Jesus, that is all.   Refrain:   Trusting as the moments fly,   Trusting as the days go by;   Trusting Him whateÂer befall,   Trusting Jesus, that is all.    2. Brightly doth His Spirit shine   Into this poor heart of mine;   While He leads I cannot fall;   Trusting Jesus, that is all.    3. Singing if my way is clear,   Praying if the path be drear;   If in danger for Him call;   Trusting Jesus, that is all.    4. Trusting Him while life shall last,   Trusting Him till earth be past;   Till within the jasper wall,   Trusting Jesus, that is all.

1 Jesus, priceless treasure,   source of purest pleasure,   friend most sure and true:   long my heart was burning,   fainting much and yearning,   thirsting, Lord, for you.   Yours I am, O spotless Lamb,   so will I let nothing hide you,   seek no joy beside you!    2 Let your arms enfold me:   those who try to wound me   cannot reach me here.   Though the earth be shaking,   every heart be quaking,   Jesus calms my fear.   Fires may flash and thunder crash;   yea, though sin and hell assail me,   Jesus will not fail me.    3 Hence, all worldly treasure!   Jesus is my pleasure,   Jesus is my choice.   Hence, all empty glory!   What to me your story   told with tempting voice?   Pain or loss or shame or cross   shall not from my Savior move me,   since he chose to love me.    4 Banish thoughts of sadness,   for the Lord of gladness,   Jesus, enters in;   though the clouds may gather,   those who love the Savior   still have peace within.   Though I bear much sorrow here,   still in you lies purest pleasure,   Jesus, priceless treasure!   Psalter Hymnal,  1987

1 O love of God, how strong and true,   eternal and yet ever new,   uncomprehended and unbought,   beyond all knowledge and all thought!   O love of God, how deep and great,   far deeper than man's deepest hate;   self-fed, self-kindled like the light,   changeless, eternal, infinite.    2 O heav'nly love, how precious still,   in days of weariness and ill,   in nights of pain and helplessness,   to heal, to comfort, and to bless!   O wide-embracing, wondrous love!   We read you in the sky above,   we read you in the earth below,   in seas that swell and streams that flow.    3 We read you best in him who came   bearing for us the cross of shame;   sent by the Father from on high,   our life to live, our death to die.   We read your pow'r to bless and save,   e'en in the darkness of the grave;   still more in resurrection light   we read the fullness of your might.    4 O love of God, our shield and stay   through all the perils of our way!   Eternal love, in you we rest,   forever safe, forever blest.   We will exalt you, God and King,   and we will ever praise your name;   we will extol you ev'ry day,   and evermore your praise proclaim.     Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal # 240

1 I bring my sins to thee,   The sins I cannot count,   That I may cleansed be   In thy once opened fount.   I bring them, Saviour, all to thee;   The burden is too great for me.    2 My heart to thee I bring,   The heart I cannot read;   A faithless, wandering thing,   An evil heart indeed.   I bring it, Saviour, now to thee   That fixed and faithful it may be.    3 To thee I bring my care,   The care I cannot flee;   Thou wilt not only share,   But bear it all for me.   O loving Saviour, now to thee   I bring the load that wearies me.    4 I bring my grief to thee,   The grief I cannot tell;   No words shall needed be,   Thou knowest all so well.   I bring the sorrow laid on me,   O suffering Saviour, now to thee.    5 My joys to thee I bring,   The joys thy love has given,   That each may be a wing   To lift me nearer Heaven.   I bring them, Saviour, all to thee;   For thou hast purchased all for me.    6 My life I bring to thee,   I would not be my own;   O Saviour, let me be   Thine ever, thine alone.   My heart, my life, my all I bring   To thee, my Saviour and my King.       Source: The Song Book of the Salvation Army # 421

1 I could not do without thee,   O Saviour of the lost,   whose precious blood redeemed me   at such tremendous cost;   thy righteousness, thy pardon,   thy precious blood, must be   my only hope and comfort,   my glory and my plea.    2 I could not do without thee,   I cannot stand alone,   I have no strength or goodness,   no wisdom of my own;   but thou, belovÃ¨d Saviour,   art all in all to me,   and weakness will be power   if leaning hard on thee.    3 I could not do without thee,   for, oh, the way is long,   and I am often weary,   and sigh replaces song:   how could I do without thee?   I do not know the way;   thou knowest, and thou leadest,   and wilt not let me stray.    4 I could not do without thee,   O Jesus, Saviour dear;   eÂen when my eyes are holden,   I know that thou art near;   how dreary and how lonely   this changeful life would be   without the sweet communion,   the secret rest with thee.    5 I could not do without thee;   no other friend can read   the spiritÂs strange deep longings,   interpreting its need;   no human heart could enter   each dim recess of mine,   and soothe, and hush, and calm it,   O BlessÃ¨d Lord, but thine.    6 I could not do without thee,   for years are fleeting fast,   and soon in solemn loneness   the river must be passed;   but thou wilt never leave me,   and though the waves roll high,   I know thou wilt be near me,   and whisper, 'It is I.'

I will not let Thee go; Thou Help in time of need!   Heap ill on ill   I trust Thee still,   E'en when it seems that thou wouldst slay indeed!

No, Lord, Thou'rt mine,   And I am Thine,   Thee will I hold when all things else I miss.   Though dark and sad the night,   Joy cometh with Thy light,   O Thou my Sun; should I forsake my bliss?   I will not let Thee go!   I will not let Thee go, my God, my Life, my Lord!   Not Death can tear   Me from His care,   Who for my sake His soul in death outpoured.

1 Sometimes a light surprises   the Christian while he sings;   it is the Lord who rises   with healing in His wings;   when comforts are declining,   He grants the soul again   a season of clear shining,   to cheer it after rain.    2 In holy contemplation,   we sweetly then pursue   the theme of GodÂs salvation,   and find it ever new.   Set free from present sorrow,   we cheerfully can say,   ÂE'en let the unknown morrow   bring with it what it may.Â    3 "It can bring with it nothing,   but He will bear us through;   who gives the lilies clothing   will clothe His people, too;   beneath the spreading heavens   no creature but is fed;   and He who feeds the ravens   will give His children bread."    4 Though vine nor fig tree neither   their wonted fruit should bear,   though all the field should wither,   nor flocks nor herds be there,   yet God the same abiding,   His praise shall tune my voice;   for while in Him confiding,   I cannot but rejoice.

1 Lord, teach us how to pray aright   with rev'rence and with fear.   Tho' dust and ashes in Your sight,   we may, we must draw near.    2 We perish if we cease from prayer;   O, grant us pow'r to pray.   And when to meet You we prepare,   Lord, meet us on our way.    3 Give deep humility; the sense   of godly sorrow give;   a strong desire with confidence,   to hear Your voice and live;    4 Faith in the only sacrifice   that can for sin atone;   to cast our hopes, to fix our eyes   on Christ, on Christ alone.    5 Give these, and then Your will be done;   thus strengthened with all might,   we, thro' Your Spirit and Your Son,   shall pray, and pray aright.

God, I'll sing out your praise!   Your mercies are so great,   your anger is so slow to rise,   so ready to abate!   The pity that you show   to those that love your word,   is such as tender parents feel:   you love your children, Lord.   Your power subdues all sins   with your forgiving love;   as far the east is from the west   is all our guilt removed.   Your great compassions, God,   endure through timeless years;   and children's children ever find   your promise ends their fears.

1 Lord, I believe a rest remains,   To all Thy people known,   A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,   And Thou art loved alone:    2 A rest, where all our soul's desire   Is fixed on things above;   Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,   Cast out by perfect love.    3 O that I now the rest might know,   Believe, and enter in!   Now, Saviour, now the power bestow,   And let me cease from sin.    4 Remove this hardness from my heart,   This unbelief remove;   To me the rest of faith impart,   The Sabbath of Thy love.    5 I would be Thine, Thou know'st I would,   And have Thee all my own;   Thee, O my all-sufficient Good!   I want, and Thee alone.     Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church # 480

HYMN 565
1 I know that my Redeemer lives,   And ever prays for me;   A token of His love He gives,   A pledge of liberty.    2 I find Him lifting up my head;   He brings salvation near;   His presence makes me free indeed,   And He will soon appear.    3 He wills that I should holy be,   What can withstand His will?   The counsel of His grace in me   He surely shall fulfill.    4 Jesus, I hang upon Thy word;   I steadfastly believe   Thou wilt return and claim me, Lord,   And to Thyself receive.    5 When God is mine and I am His,   Of paradise possessed,   I taste unutterable bliss   And everlasting rest.

1 God of all redeeming grace,   By thy pard'ning love compell'd   Up to thee our souls we raise,   Up to thee our bodies yield:   Thou our sacrifice receive,   Acceptable through thy Son,   While to thee alone we live,   While we die to thee alone.    2 Meet it is, and just and right,   That we should be wholly thine;   In thy only will delight,   In thy blessed service join:   O that ev'ry work and word   Might proclaim how good thou art:   Holiness unto the Lord   Still be wrote upon our heart!

1 In all my vast concerns with Thee,   In vain my soul would try   To shun Thy presence, Lord, or flee   The notice of Thine eye.    2 My thoughts lie open to the Lord   Before they're formed within;   And ere my lips pronounce the word,   He knows the sense I mean.    3 O wondrous knowledge, deep and high,   Where can a creature hide?   Within Thy circling arms I lie,   Enclosed on every side.    4 So let Thy grace surround me still,   And like a bulwark prove   To guard my soul from every ill,   Secured by Sovereign love.

1 Blessed are the pure in heart,   They have loved the better part;   When lifeÂs journey they have trod,   They shall go to see their God.   Till in glory they appear,   They shall often see Him here;   And His grace shall learn to know   In His glorious works below.    2 When the sun begins to rise,   Spreading brightness through the skies,   They will love to praise and bless   Christ, the Son of Righteousness.   In the watches of the night,   When the stars are clear and bright,   ÂThus the just shall shineÂ they say,   ÂIn the Resurrection day.Â    3 When the leaves in autumn die,   Falling fast and silently,   ÂThese,Â they thing, Âthat now seem dead,   Shall in spring lift up their head.Â   God in every thing they see;   First in all their thoughts is He;   They have loved the better part;Â   Blessed are the pure in heart!

1 Behold the servant of the Lord!   I wait thy guiding eye to feel,   To hear and keep thy ev'ry word,   To prove and do thy perfect will;   Joyful from my own works to cease,   Glad to fulfil all righteousness.    2 Me if thy grace vouchsafe to use,   Meanest of all thy creatures, me,   The deed, the time, the manner chuse,   Let all my fruit be found of thee;   Let all my works in thee be wrought,   By thee to full perfection brought.    3 My ev'ry weak, though good design,   OÂer-rule, or change, as seems thee meet;   Jesu, let all my work be thine!

HYMN 573
1 O God, what offering shall I give   To thee, the Lord of earth and skies?   My spirit, soul and flesh receive,   A holy, living sacrifice;   Small as it is, Âtis all my store,   More shouldst thou have if I had more.    2 Now, O my God, thou hast my soul,   No longer mine, but thine I am;   Guard thou thine own, possess it whole,   Cheer it with hope, with love inflame;   Thou hast my spirit, there display   Thy glory to the perfect day.    3 Thou hast my flesh, thy hallowed shrine,   Devoted solely to thy will;   Here let thy light for ever shine,   This house still let thy presence fill;   O Source of life, live, dwell and move   In me, till all my life be love!    4 Send down thy likeness from above,   And let this my adorning be;   Clothe me with wisdom, patience, love,   With lowliness and purity,   Than gold and pearls more precious far,   And brighter than the morning star.    5 Lord, arm me with thy SpiritÂs might,   Since I am called by thy great name;   In thee let all my thoughts unite,   Of all my works be thou the aim;   Thy love attend me all my days,   And my sole business be thy praise.

End of my every action Thou,   In all things Thee I see;   Accept my hallowed labor now,   I do it unto Thee.    4.

To tend the vines, the grapes to store,   Thou dost appoint for some:   Thou hast thy young men at the war,   Thy little ones at home.    3 All works are good, and each is best   As most it pleases thee;   Each worker pleases when the rest   He serves in charity;   And neither man nor work unblest,   Wilt thou permit to be.    4 Our Master all the work hath done   He asks of us to-day;   Sharing his service, every one   Share too his sonship may;   Lord, I would serve and be a son:   Dismiss me not, I pray.

Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away;   It is not thus that souls are won.    5 Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray;   be wise the erring soul to win;   go forth into the world's highway,   compel the wand'rer to come in.    6 Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;   for toil comes rest, for exile home;   soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,   the midnight peal, "Behold, I come."

Millions of transgressors poor   Thou hast for Jesus' sake forgiven,   Made them of Thy favor sure,   And snatched from hell to Heaven.    4. Millions more Thou ready art   To save, and to forgive;   Every soul and every heart   Of man Thou wouldst receive:   Father, now accept of mine,   Which now, through Christ, I offer Thee;   Tell me now, in love divine,   That Thou hast pardoned me!

HYMN 596
1 Make me a captive, Lord,   And then I shall be free.   Force me to render up my sword   And I shall conqueror be.   I sink in life's alarms   When by myself I stand;   Imprison me within thine arms,   And strong shall be my hand.    2 My heart is weak and poor   Until it master find;   It has no spring of action sure,   It varies with the wind.   It cannot freely move   Till thou hast wrought its chain;   Enslave it with thy matchless love,   And deathless it shall reign.    3 My pow'r is faint and low   Till I have learned to serve;   It lacks the needed fire to glow,   It lacks the breeze to nerve.   It cannot drive the world   Until itself be driv'n;   Its flag can only be unfurled   When thou shalt breathe from heav'n.    4 My will is not my own   Till thou hast made it thine;   If it would reach a monarch's throne,   It must its crown resign.   It only stands unbent   Amid the clashing strife   When on thy bosom it has leant,   And found in thee its life.   ---    1 CautÃ­vame, SeÃ±or,   y libre en ti serÃ©;   anhelo ser un vencedor,   rindiÃ©ndome a tus pies.   No puedo ya confiar   tan sÃ³lo en mi poder,   en ti yo quiero descansar   y fuerte habrÃ© de ser.    2 Mi dÃ©bil corazÃ³n   vacila sin cesar,   y es como nave sin timÃ³n   en turbulento mar.   ConcÃ©dele, SeÃ±or,   perfecta libertad;   envuÃ©lvele en tu santo amor   y libre asÃ­ serÃ¡.    3 Sin fuerzas para amar,   y asÃ­ mejor vivir;   tÃº sÃ³lo puedes inspirar   el gozo de servir.   Quisiera desplegar   mis alas, oh SeÃ±or,   mas solo lo podrÃ© lograr   al soplo de tu amor.    4 CautÃ­vame, SeÃ±or,   que en ti mi voluntad   tendrÃ¡ un bautismo de vigor,   firmeza y santidad.   PodrÃ¡ la tentaciÃ³n   mi vida sacudir;   no habrÃ¡ mÃ¡s cierta protecciÃ³n   que la que encuentre en ti.

1 Holy Lamb, who Thee confess,   Followers of Thy holiness,   Thee they ever keep in view,   Ever ask, "What shall we do?"   Governed by Thy only will,   All Thy words we would fulfil;   Would in all Thy footsteps go,   Walk as Jesus walked below.    2 While Thou didst on earth appear,   Servant to Thy servants here,   Mindful of Thy place above,   All Thy life was prayer and love.   Such our whole employment be,   Works of faith and charity;   Works of love on man bestowed,   Secret intercourse with God.    3 Early in the temple met,   Let us still our Saviour greet;   Nightly to the mount repair,   Join our praying Pattern there.   There by wrestling faith obtain   Power to work for God again,   Power His image to retrieve,   Power, like Thee, our Lord, to live.    4 Vessels, instruments of grace,   Pass we thus our happy days   'Twixt the mount and multitude.   Doing or receiving good;   Glad to pray and labour on,   Till our earthly course is run,   Till, our sufferings ended, we   Bow the head and die like Thee.

1. Ere God had built the mountains,   Or raised the fruitful hills;   Before He filled the fountains   That feed the running rills;   In me from everlasting,   The wonderful I Am,   Found pleasures never wasting,   And Wisdom is my name.    2. When, like a tent to dwell in,   He spread the skies abroad,   And swathed about the swelling   Of Ocean's mighty flood;   He wrought by weight and measure,   And I was with Him then:   Myself the Father's pleasure,   And mine, the sons of men.    3. Thus Wisdom's words discover   Thy glory and Thy grace,   Thou everlasting Lover   Of our unworthy race!   Thy gracious eye surveyed us   Ere stars were seen above;   In wisdom Thou hast made us,   And died for us in love.    4.

Let the fire and cloudy pillar   lead me all my journey through.   Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,   ever be my strength and shield,   ever be my strength and shield.    3 When I tread the verge of Jordan,   bid my anxious fears subside.   Death of death, and hell's Destruction,   land me safe on Canaan's side.   Songs of praises, songs of praises   I will ever sing to you,   I will ever sing to you.   Psalter Hymnal, (Gray)

1 Through the night of doubt and sorrow   onward goes the pilgrim band,   singing songs of expectation,   marching to the promised land.    2 Clear before us through the darkness   gleams and burns the guiding light;   pilgrim clasps the hand of pilgrim,   stepping fearless through the night.    3 One the light of God's own presence   o'er his ransomed people shed,   chasing far the gloom and terror,   brightening all the path we tread:    4 One the object of our journey,   one the faith which never tires,   one the earnest looking forward,   one the hope our God inspires:    5 One the strain that lips of thousands   lift as from the heart of one;   one the conflict, one the peril,   one the march in God begun:    6 One the gladness of rejoicing   on the far eternal shore,   where the one almighty Father   reigns in love for evermore.    7 Onward, therefore, Christian pilgrims,   onward with the cross our aid;   bear its shame, and fight its battle,   till we rest beneath its shade.    8 Soon shall come the great awaking,   soon the rending of the tomb;   then the scattering of all shadows,   and the end of toil and gloom.

Forward, out of error,   Leave behind the night;   Forward through the darkness,   Forward into light!    3 Glories upon glories   Hath our God prepared,   By the souls that love Him   One day to be shared!   Eye hath not beheld them,   Ear hath never heard;   Nor of these hath uttered   Thought or speech a word:   Forward, marching eastward   Where the heaven is bright.   Till the veil be lifted,   Till our faith be sight!    4 Far o'er yon horizon   Rise the city towers,   Where our God abideth;   That fair home is ours:   Flash the streets with jasper,   Shine the gates with gold;   Flows the gladdening river   Shedding joys untold.

1 O love, how deep, how broad, how high,   how passing thought and fantasy,   that God, the Son of God, should take   our mortal form for mortals' sake!    2 He sent no angel to our race,   of higher or of lower place,   but wore the robe of human frame,   and He Himself to this world came.    3 For us baptized, for us He bore   His holy fast, and hungered sore;   for us temptations sharp He knew,   for us the tempter overthrew.    4 For us to wicked men betrayed,   scourged, mocked, in crown of thorns arrayed,   He bore the shameful cross and death   for us at length gave up His breath.    5 For us He rose from death again,   for us He went on high to reign,   for us He sent His Spirit here   to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.    6 All glory to our Lord and God   for love so deep, so high, so broadÃÂ   the Trinity whom we adore   forever and forevermore.

1 When on my day of life the night is falling,   And in the winds from unsunned spaces blown   I hear far voices out of darkness calling   My feet to paths unknown--    2 Thou, who hast made my home of life so pleasant,   Leave not its tenant when its walls decay;   O Love Divine, O Helper ever present,   Be Thou my strength and stay!    3 Be near me when all else is from me drifting   Earth, sky, home's pictures, days of shade and shine,   And kindly faces to my own uplifting   The love which answers mine.    4 I have but Thee, my Father! let Thy Spirit   Be with me then to comfort and uphold;   No gate of pearl, no branch of palm I merit,   Nor street of shining gold.    5 Suffice it if my good and ill unreckoned,   And both forgiven through Thy abounding grace   I find myself by hands familiar beckoned   Unto my fitting place.    6 Some humble door among Thy many mansions,   Some sheltering shade where sin and striving cease,   And flows for ever through heaven's green expansions   The river of Thy peace.    7 There from the music round about me stealing   I fain would learn the new and holy song.   And find at last, beneath Thy trees of healing,   The life for which I long.     Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church # 468a

1 When this passing world is done,   when has sunk yon glaring sun,   when we stand with Christ on high   looking o'er life's history,   then, Lord, shall I fully know,   not till then, how much I owe.    2 When I hear the wicked call   on the rocks and hills to fall,   when I see them start and shrink   on the fiery deluge brink,   then, Lord, shall I fully know,   not till then, how much I owe.    3 When I stand before the throne,   dressed in beauty not my own,   when I see thee as thou art,   love thee with unsinning heart,   then, Lord, shall I fully know,   not till then, how much I owe.    4 When the praise of heav'n I hear,   loud as thunders to the ear,   loud as many waters' noise,   sweet as harp's melodious voice,   then, Lord, shall I fully know,   not till then, how much I owe.    5 Chosen not for good in me,   wakened up from wrath to flee,   hidden in the Savior's side,   by the Spirit sanctified,   teach me, Lord, on earth to show,   by my love, how much I owe.

1 Day of wrath, O day of mourning!   See fulfilled the prophet's warning:   Heav'n and earth in ashes burning.   Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,   Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth,   All before the throne it bringeth.   O what fear man's bosom rendeth   When from heav'n the Judge descendeth   On whose sentence all dependeth.    2 Death is struck and nature quaking;   All creation is awaking,   To its Judge an answer making.   Lo, the book, exactly worded,   Wherein all hath been recorded;   Thence shall judgment be awarded.   When the Judge His seat attaineth,   And each hidden deed arraigneth,   Nothing unavenged remaineth.    3 What shall I, frail man, be pleading,   Who for me be interceding   When the just are mercy needing?   King of Majesty tremendous,   Who dost free salvation send us,   Fount of pity, then befriend us!   Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution   Grant Thy gift of absolution   Ere the Day of Retribution.    4 Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,   On the cross of suff'ring bought me;   Shall such grace be vainly brought me?   Think, good Jesus, my salvation   Caused Thy wondrous incarnation;   Leave me not to sin's damnation!   Guilty now I pour my moaning,   All my shame with anguish owning:   Hear, O Christ, Thy servant's groaning!    5 Bows my heart in meek submission,   Strewn with ashes of contrition;   Help me in my last condition!   Worthless are my prayers and sighing;   Yet, Good Lord, in grace complying,   Rescue me from fires undying.   Thou the sinful woman savedst;   Thou the dying thief forgavest;   Thus to me true hope vouchsafest!    6 With Thy favored sheep then place me,   Nor among the goats abase me,   But to Thy right hand upraise me.   While the wicked are confounded,   Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,   Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.   To the rest Thou didst prepare me   On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me!   Spare, O God, in mercy spare me.       Source: Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary # 537

1 Lord, it belongs not to my care   whether I die or live:   to love and serve thee is my share,   and this thy grace must give. 2 Christ leads me through no darker rooms   than he went through before;   he that into God's kingdom comes   must enter by this door. 3 Come, Lord, when grace hath made me meet   thy blessed face to see;   for if thy work on earth be sweet,   what will thy glory be! 4 Then shall I end my sad complaints   and weary, sinful days,   and join with the triumphant saints   that sing my Saviour's praise. 5 My knowledge of that life is small,   the eye of faith is dim;   but 'tis enough that Christ knows all,   and I shall be with him.

1 Away with our sorrow and fear!   We soon shall recover our home;   The city of saints shall appear,   The day of eternity come.   From earth we shall quickly remove,   And mount to our promised abode,   The house of our Father above,   The palace of angels and God.    2 By faith we already behold   That lovely Jerusalem here;   Her walls are of jasper and gold,   As crystal her buildings are clear.

1 There is a land of pure delight,   where saints immortal reign;   infinite day excludes the night,   and pleasures banish pain. 2 There everlasting spring abides,   and never-withering flowers;   death, like a narrow sea, divides   that heavenly land from ours. 3 Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood   stand dressed in living green;   so to the Jews old Canaan stood,   while Jordan rolled between. 4 But timorous mortals start and shrink   to cross the narrow sea,   and linger shivering on the brink,   and fear to launch away. 5 O could we make our doubts remove,   those gloomy doubts that rise,   and see the Canaan that we love   with unbeclouded eyes; 6 Could we but climb where Moses stood,   and view the landscape o'er,   not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,   should fright us from the shore!

1 SWEET is the work, my God, my King   To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing;   To show Thy love by morning light,   And talk of all Thy truth at night. 2 Sweet is the day of sacred rest,   No mortal cares disturb my breast,   O may my heart in tune be found,   Like DavidÂ’s harp of solemn sound! 3 My heart shall triumph in the Lord,   And bless His works and bless His word:   Thy works of grace, how bright they shine!   How deep Thy counsels, how divine! 4 And I shall share a glorious part,   When grace has well refined my heart,   And fresh supplies of joy are shed,   Like holy oil, to cheer my head. 5 Then shall I see, and hear, and know,   All I desired or wished below;   And every power find sweet employ   In that eternal world of joy.

1 We rose to-day with anthems sweet   To sing before the mercy-seat,   And ere the darkness round us fell   We bade the grateful vespers swell.    2 Whate'ever has risen from heart sincere,   Each upward glance of filial fear,   Each true resolve, each solemn vow,   Jesus our Lord, accept them now.    3 Whate'er beneath Thy searching eyes   Has wrought to spoil our sacrifice,   'Mid this sweet stillness while we bow,   Jesus our Lord, forgive us now.    4 O teach us erring souls to win,   And hide their multitude of sin,   To tread in Christ's longsuffering way,   And grow more like Him day by day.    5 So as our Sabbaths hasten past,   And rounding years bring nigh the last;   When sinks the sun behind the hill,   When all the weary wheels stand still;    6 When by our bed the loved ones weep,   And death-dews o'er the forehead creep,   And vain is help or hope from men;   Jesus our Lord, receive us then.

84 DEAR Lord and Father of mankind,   Forgive our foolish ways!   Re-clothe us in our rightful mind,   In purer lives Thy service find,   In deeper reverence, praise. 2 In simple trust like theirs who heard,   Beside the Syrian sea,   The gracious calling of the Lord,   Let us, like them, without a word   Rise up and follow Thee. 3 O Sabbath rest by Galilee!   O calm of hills above,   Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee   The silence of eternity,   Interpreted by love. 4 With that deep hush subduing all   Our words and works that drown   The tender whisper of Thy call,   As noiseless let Thy blessing fall   As fell Thy manna down. 5 Drop Thy still dews of quietness,   Till all our strivings cease;   Take from our souls the strain and stress,   And let our ordered lives confess   The beauty of Thy peace. 6 Breathe through the heats of our desire   Thy coolness and Thy balm;   Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;   Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,   O still, small voice of calm!

O Jesu, lover of mankind,   Who would not his whole soul and mind,   With all his strength, to Thee unite. 2 Thou shin'st with everlasting rays;   Before th'insufferable blaze   Angels with both wings veil their eyes:   Yet free as air Thy bounty streams   On all Thy works; Thy mercy's beams   Diffusive as Thy sun's arise. 3 Fountain of good! All blessing flows   From Thee; no want Thy fulness knows;   What but Thyself canst Thou desire?   Yet, self-sufficient as Thou art,   Thou dost desire my worthless heart;   This, only this, dost Thou require. 4 High throned on heav'n's eternal hill,   In number, weight, and measure still   Thou sweetly orderest all that is:   And yet Thou deign'st to come to me,   And guide my steps, that I, with Thee   Enthroned, may reign in endless bliss.

1. Jesus, Thou soul of all our joys,   For whom we now lift up our voice,   And all our strength exert;   Vouchsafe the grace we humbly claim,   Compose into a thankful frame,   And tune Thy peoples heart.    2. While in the heavenly work we join,   Thy glory be our whole design,   Thy glory, not our own:   Still let us keep our end in view,   And still the pleasing task pursue,   To please our God alone.    3. The secret pride, the subtle sin,   O let it never more steal in,   To offend Thy glorious eyes,   To desecrate our hallowed strain,   And make our solemn service vain,   And mar our sacrifice!    4. To magnify Thy awful name,   To spread the honors of the Lamb,   Let us our voices raise;   Our souls and bodies powers unite,   Regardless of our own delight,   And dead to human praise.    5. Still let us on our guard be found,   And watch against the power of sound   With sacred jealousy;   Lest haply sense should damp our zeal,   And musics charms bewitch and steal   Our hearts away from Thee.    6. That hurrying strife far oft remove,   That noisy burst of selfish love,   Which swells the formal song;   The joy from out our hearts arise,   And speak and sparkle in our eyes,   And vibrate on our tongue.    7. Thee let us praise, our common Lord,   And sweetly join with one accord   Thy goodness to proclaim:   Jesus, Thyself in us reveal,   And all our faculties shall feel   Thy harmonizing name.    8. With calmly reverential joy,   O let us all our lives employ   In setting forth Thy love;   And raise in death our triumph higher,   And sing with all the heavenly choir,   That endless song above!

E'en so, with one accord,   we lift them up, we lift them to the Lord. 2 Above the level of the former years,   the mire of sin, the slough of guilty fears,   the mist of doubt, the blight of love's decay,   O Lord of light, lift all our hearts to-day. 3 Above the swamps of subterfuge and shame,   the deeds, the thoughts, that honour may not name,   the halting tongue that dares not tell the whole,   O Lord of truth, lift every Christian soul. 4 Lift every gift that thou thyself hast given:   low lies the best till lifted up to heaven;   low lie the bounding heart, the teeming brain,   till, sent from God, they mount to God again. 5 Then, as the trumpet-call in after years,   'Lift up your hearts!' rings pealing in our ears,   still shall those hearts respond with full accord,   'We lift them up, we lift them to the Lord!'

1 O God our Father, who dost make us one,   Heart bound to heart, in love of Thy dear Son,   Now as we part and go our several ways,   Touch every lip, may every voice be praise Â–    2 Praise for the fellowship that here we find,   The fellowship of heart and soul and mind,   Praise for the bonds of love and brotherhood,   Bonds wrought by Thee, who makest all things good.    3 Lord, make us strong, for Thee alone dost know   How oft we turn our faces from the foe;   How oft, when claimed by dark temptation's hour,   We lose our hold on Thee, and of Thy power.    4 God with us, Lord, from hence; we only ask   That Thou be sharer in our daily task;   So, side by side with Thee, shall each one know   The blessedness of heaven begun below.

1 At even, ere the sun was set,   the sick, O Lord, around thee lay;   O in what divers pains they met!   O with what joy they went away! 2 Once more 'tis eventide, and we   oppressed with various ills draw near;   what if thy form we cannot see?   we know and feel that thou art here. 3 O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel;   for some are sick, and some are sad,   and some have never loved thee well,   and some have lost the love they had; 4 And some have found the world is vain,   yet from the world they break not free;   and some have friends who give them pain,   yet have not sought a friend in thee; 5 And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,   for none are wholly free from sin;   and they who fain would serve thee best   are conscious most of wrong within. 6 O Saviour Christ, thou too art man;   thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;   thy kind but searching glance can scan   the very wounds that shame would hide. 7 Thy touch has still its ancient power;   no word from thee can fruitless fall:   Hear, in this solemn evening hour,   and in thy mercy heal us all.

1 NONE is like Jeshurun's God,   So great, so strong, so high;   Lo! He spreads His wings abroad,   He rides upon the sky:   Israel is His first-born son;   God, th'almighty God, is thine;   See Him to Thy help come down,   The excellence divine. 2 Thee the great Jehovah deigns   To succour and defend;   Thee the eternal God sustains,   Thy Maker and thy Friend:   Israel, what hast thou to dread?   Safe from all impending harms,   Round thee and beneath are spread   The everlasting arms. 3 In a land of corn and wine   His lot shall be below;   Comforts there, and blessings join,   And milk and honey flow;   Jacob's well is in his soul:   Gracious dew his heavens distil,   Fill his soul, already full,   And shall for ever fill. 4 Blest, O Israel art Thou!   What people is like thee?   Saved from sin by Jesus, now   Thou art and still shalt be;   Jesus is thy sevenfold shield,   Jesus is thy flaming sword;   Earth, and hell, and sin shall yield   To God's almighty Word.

1 Our day of praise is done;   the evening shadows fall;   but pass not from us with the sun,   true Light that lightenest all.    2 Around the throne on high,   where night can never be,   the white-robed harpers of the sky   bring ceaseless hymns to thee.    3 Too faint our anthems here;   too soon of praise we tire;   but O the strains how full and clear   of that eternal choir!    4 Yet, Lord, to thy dear will   if thou attune the heart,   we in thine angels music still   may bear our lower part.    5 Tis thine each soul to calm,   each wayward thought reclaim,   and make our life a daily psalm   of glory to thy name.    6 A little while, and then   shall come the glorious end;   and songs of angels and of men   in perfect praise shall blend.

Evermore   from his store   new-born worlds rise and adore. 4 Daily doth th' Almighty giver   bounteous gifts on us bestow;   his desire our soul delighteth,   pleasure leads us where we go.   Love doth stand   at his hand;   joy doth wait on his command. 5 Still from earth to God eternal   sacrifice of praise be done,   high above all praises praising   for the gift of Christ his Son.

One holy name she blesses,   partakes one holy food,   and to one hope she presses,   with every grace endued.    3 Though with a scornful wonder,   men see her sore oppressed,   by schisms rent asunder,   by heresies distressed,   yet saints their watch are keeping,   their cry goes up, "How long?"   and soon the night of weeping   shall be the morn of song!    4 The church shall never perish!   Her dear Lord to defend,   to guide, sustain, and cherish,   is with her to the end;   though there be those that hate her,   and false sons in her pale,   against the foe or traitor   she ever shall prevail.    5 'Mid toil and tribulation,   and tumult of her war,   she waits the consummation   of peace forevermore;   till with the vision glorious   her longing eyes are blest,   and the great church victorious   shall be the church at rest.    6 Yet she on earth hath union   with God the Three in One,   and mystic sweet communion   with those whose rest is won;   O happy ones and holy!

1 How pleasant, how divinely fair,   O LORD of hosts, your dwellings are!   With long desire my spirit faints   to see the shining hosts of saints.   My flesh would rest in you abode;   my weary heart cries out for God:   "My God! My King! Why should I stay   far from the joys of endless day?"    2 The sparrow has a place to rest,   and for her young provides a nest,   but will my God to them alone   pour out his mercy from the throne?   Blest are the saints who dwell on high   around your throne, above the sky;   their brightest glories shine above,   and all their work is praise and love.    3 Great God, attend, while Zion sings   the joy that from your presence springs;   to spend a day within your courts   exceeds a thousand days apart.   You are our sun, you bless our day;   and you our shield, to guard our way   from all assaults of hell and sin,   from foes without and fears within.    4 All needed grace you will bestow,   and crown that grace with glory too;   you give all things, and you withhold   no heav'nly good from upright souls.

1 O Christ, our God, who with Thine own hast been,   Our spirits cleave to Thee, the Friend unseen.    2 Vouchsafe that all who on Thy bounty feed   May heed Thy love, and prize Thy gifts indeed.    3 Make every heart that is Thy dwelling-place   A watered garden filled with fruits of grace.    4 Each holy purpose help us to fulfil;   Increase our faith to feed upon Thee still.    5 Illuminate our minds, that we may see   In all around us holy signs of Thee.    6 And may such witness in our lives appear,   That all may know Thou hast been with us here.    7 O grant us peace, that by Thy peace possessed,   Thy life within us we may manifest.    8 So shall we pass our days in holy fear,   In joyful consciousness that Thou art near.    9 So shalt Thou be for ever, loving Lord,   Our Shield and our exceeding great Reward.

1 Sweetly the holy hymn   Breaks on the morning air;   Before the world with smoke is dim,   We meet to offer prayer.    2 While flow'rs are wet with dews,   Dew of our souls, descend;   Ere yet the sun the day renews,   O Lord, Thy Spirit send.    3 Upon the battlefield,   Before the fight begins,   We seek, O Lord, Thy shelt'ring shield,   To guard us from our sins.    4 On the lone mountain side,   Before the morning's light,   The Man of sorrows wept and cried,   And rose refreshed with might.    5 Oh, hear us then, for we   Are very weak and frail,   We make the Saviour's name our plea,   And surely must prevail.

1 Jesus, Sun of righteousness,   Brightest beam of love divine,   With the early morning rays   Do Thou on our darkness shine,   And dispel with purest light   All our long and gloomy night.    2 Like the sun's reviving ray,   May Thy love, with tender glow,   All our coldness melt away   Warm and cheer us forth to go,   Thee to honor and obey   All our life's short earthly day.    3 Thou our only Hope and Guide,   Never leave us nor forsake:   In Thy light may we abide   Till the endless morning break,   Moving to Thy holy hill   Onward, upward, homeward still.    4 Lead us all our days and years   In Thy straight and narrow way;   Lead us through this vale of tears   To the land of perfect day,   Where Thy people, fully blest,   Near Thy throne forever rest.

1 We have not known thee as we ought,   nor learned thy wisdom, grace and pow'r;   the things of earth have filled our thought,   and trifles of the passing hour.   Lord, give us light thy truth to see,   and make us wise in knowing thee.    2 We have not feared thee as we ought,   nor bowed beneath thine awesome eye,   nor guarded deed and word and thought,   remembering that God was nigh.   Lord, give us faith to know thee near,   and grant the grace of holy fear.    3 We have not loved thee as we ought,   nor cared that we are loved by thee;   thy presence we have coldly sought,   and feebly longed thy face to see.   Lord, give a pure and loving heart   to feel and own the love thou art.    4 We have not served thee as we ought;   alas! the duties left undone,   the work with little fervor wrought,   the battles lost or scarcely won!   Lord, give the zeal and give the might,   for thee to toil, for thee to fight.    5 When shall we know thee as we ought,   and fear and love and serve aright!   When shall we, out of trial brought,   be perfect in the land of light!   Lord, may we day by day prepare   to see thy face and serve thee there.       Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal # 178

Yet come, Thou heavÂ’nly guest,   And purify my breast;   Come, Thou great and glorious King,   While before Thy cross I bow;   With Thyself salvation bring,   Cleanse the house by entering now.

1 Jesu, we thus obey   thy last and kindest word;   here in thine own appointed way   we come to meet thee, Lord.    2 Our hearts we open wide,   to make the Saviour room;   and lo, the Lamb, the Crucified,   the sinner's friend is come!    3 Thy presence makes the feast;   now let our spirits feel   the glory not to be expressed,   the joy unspeakable.    4 With high and heavenly bliss   thou dost our spirits cheer;   thy house of banqueting is this   and thou hast brought us here.    5 Now let our souls be fed   with manna from above,   and over us your banner spread   of everlasting love.

1 Disposer supreme, and Judge of the earth,   who choosest for thine the meek and the poor;   to frail earthen vessels, and things of no worth,   entrusting thy riches which ay shall endure; 2 Those vessels soon fail, though full of thy light,   and at thy decree are broken and gone;   thence brightly appeareth thy truth in its might,   as through the clouds riven the lightnings have shone. 3 Like clouds are they borne to do thy great will,   and swift as the winds about the world go:   the Word with his wisdom their spirits doth fill;   they thunder, they lighten, the waters o'erflow. 4 Their sound goeth forth, 'Christ Jesus the Lord!'   then Satan doth fear, his citadels fall;   as when the dread trumpets went forth at thy word,   and one long blast shattered the Canaanite's wall. 5 O loud be their trump, and stirring their sound,   to rouse us, O Lord, from slumber of sin:   the lights thou hast kindled in darkness around,   O may they awaken our spirits within. 6 All honour and praise, dominion and might,   to God, Three in One, eternally be,   who round us hath shed his own marvellous light,   and called us from darkness his glory to see.

1 PRAISE ye the Lord! 'Tis good to raise   Your hearts and voices in His praise:   His nature and His works invite   To make this duty our delight. 2 He formed the stars, those heavenly flames,   He counts their numbers, calls their names;   His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound,   A deep where all our thoughts are drowned. 3 Sing to the Lord! Exalt Him high,   Who spreads His clouds along the sky;   There He prepares the fruitful rain,   Nor lets the drops descend in vain. 4 He makes the grass the hills adorn,   And clothes the smiling fields with corn;   The beasts with food His hands supply,   And the young ravens when they cry. 5 What is the creature's skill or force?   The sprightly man, or warlike horse?   The piercing wit, the active limb?   All are too mean delights for Him. 6 But saints are lovely in His sight,   He views His children with delight;   He sees their hope, He knows their fear,   And looks, and loves His image there.

1 Look from your sphere of endless day,   O God of mercy and of might;   In pity look on those who stray   So blindly in this land of light.    2 Send us, your people, Lord, to call   The thoughtless, hardened young and old,   A scattered homeless flock, till all   Are gathered in your peaceful fold.    3 Give us your mighty Word, to speak   Till faith is born and doubts depart,   To awe the bold, to stay the weak,   And bind and heal the broken heart.    4 Then all these wastes, a dreary scene   That makes us sadden as we gaze,   Shall bloom with living waters green   And lift to heav'n the voice of praise.

Praise for souls believingtasting   All Thy love has won for them. 4 Set on fire our hearts devotion   With the love of Thy dear name;   Till oer every land and ocean   Lips and lives Thy Cross proclaim,   Fix our eyes on Thy returning,   Keeping watch till Thou shalt come;   Loins well girt, lamps brightly burning;   Then, Lord, take Thy servants home.

1 O worship the King all-glorious above,   O gratefully sing his power and his love:   our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days,   pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.    2 O tell of his might and sing of his grace,   whose robe is the light, whose canopy space.   His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,   and dark is his path on the wings of the storm.    3 Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite?   It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;   it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,   and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.    4 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,   in you do we trust, nor find you to fail.

1 God is working this purpose out,   as year succeeds to year;   God is working this purpose out,   and the time is drawing near;   nearer and nearer draws the time,   the time that shall surely be:   when the earth shall be filled with the glory of God   as the waters cover the sea.    2 From utmost east to utmost west,   where human feet have trod,   by the mouth of many messengers   goes forth the voice of God:   Give ear to me, ye continents,   ye isles, give ear to me,   that the earth may be filled with the glory of God   as the waters cover the sea.    3 Let us go forth in the strength of God,   with the banner of Christ unfurled,   that the light of the glorious gospel of truth   may shine throughout the world.   Let us all fight with sorrow and sin   to set the captives free,   that the earth may be filled with the glory of God   as the waters cover the sea.    4 All we can do is nothing worth   unless God blesses the deed.   Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide   till God gives life to the seed.   Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,   the time that shall surely be,   when the earth shall be filled with the glory of God   as the waters cover the sea.     Source: Voices Together # 770

1 The Lord will come and not be slow,   his footsteps cannot err;   before him righteousness shall go,   his royal harbinger.    2 Truth from the earth, like to a flow'r,   shall bud and blossom then,   and justice, from her heav'nly bow'r,   look down on mortal men.    3 Rise, God, and judge the earth in might,   this wicked earth redress;   for you are he who shall by right   the nations all possess.    4 For great you are, and wonders great   by your strong hand are done:   you, in your everlasting seat,   remain the Lord alone.

1 The Son of God goes forth to war,   a kingly crown to gain;   His blood-red banner streams afar!   Who follows in his train?   Who best can drink His cup of woe,   triumphant over pain,   who patient bears his cross below,   he follows in His train.    2 The martyr first, whose eagle eye   could pierce beyond the grave;   who saw his Master in the sky   and called on Him to save.   Like Him, with pardon on His tongue   in midst of mortal pain,   he prayed for them that did the wrong!   Who follows in His train?    3 A glorious band, the chosen few   on whom the Spirit came,   twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,   and mocked the cross and flame.   They met the tyrant's brandished steel,   the lion's gory mane;   they bowed their necks the death to feel:   who follows in their train?    4 A noble army, men and boys,   the matron and the maid,   around the Savior's throne rejoice   in robes of light arrayed.   They climbed the steep ascent of heav'n   through peril, toil and pain;   O God, to us may grace be giv'n   to follow in their train.     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 429

Jesus, Thou hast bought us, not with gold or gem,   But with Thine own lifeblood, for Thy diadem;   With Thy blessing filling each who comes to Thee,   Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free.   By Thy grand redemption, by Thy grace divine,   We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine!    4. Fierce may be the conflict, strong may be the foe,   But the Kings own army none can overthrow;   Round His standard ranging, victry is secure,   For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure.

From vict'ry unto vict'ry   his army he shall lead   till ev'ry foe is vanquished   and Christ is Lord indeed.    2 Stand up, stand up for Jesus,   the trumpet call obey;   forth to the mighty conflict   in this his glorious day.   Ye that are men now serve him   against unnumbered foes;   let courage rise with danger   and strength to strength oppose.    3 Stand up, stand up for Jesus,   stand in his strength alone;   the arm of flesh will fail you,   ye dare not trust your own.   Put on the gospel armor,   each piece put on with prayer;   where duty calls or danger,   be never wanting there.    4 Stand up, stand up for Jesus,   the strife will not be long;   this day the noise of battle,   the next, the victor's song.

Ten thousand to their endless home   this solemn moment fly,   and we are to the margin come,   and we expect to die.   E'en now by faith we join our hands   with those that went before,   and greet the blood-besprinkled bands   on the eternal shore.    4.

1 When his salvation bringing,   to Zion Jesus came,   the children all stood singing   hosannas to his name:   nor did their zeal offend him,   but as he rode along,   he let them still attend him,   and smiled to hear their song.    2 And since the Lord retaineth   his love for children still,   though now as King he reigneth   on Zion's heav'nly hill,   we'll flock around his banner   who sits upon his throne,   and cry aloud, "Hosanna   to David's royal Son!"    3 For should we fail proclaiming   our great Redeemer's praise,   the stones, our silence shaming,   would their hosannas raise.   But shall we only render   the tribute of our words?   No, while our hearts are tender,   they too shall be the Lord's.       Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal # 328

HYMN 836
1 Hosanna, loud hosanna   the little children sang;   through pillared court and temple   the lovely anthem rang.   To Jesus, who had blessed them,   close folded to his breast,   the children sang their praises,   the simplest and the best.    2 From Olivet they followed   mid an exultant crowd,   the victory palm branch waving,   and chanting clear and loud.   The Lord of earth and heaven   rode on in lowly state,   nor scorned that little children   should on his bidding wait.    3 "Hosanna in the highest!"   That ancient song we sing,   for Christ is our Redeemer,   the Lord of heaven, our King.   O may we ever praise him   with heart and life and voice,   and in his blissful presence   eternally rejoice.   Psalter Hymnal

HYMN 837
1 Children of Jerusalem   Sang the praise of Jesus name;   Children, too, of modern days   Join to sing the Saviors praise.   Refrain:   Hark, hark, hark, while infant voices sing,   Hark, hark, hark, while infant voices sing   Loud hosannas, loud hosannas,   loud hosannas to our King.    2 We are taught to love the Lord,   We are taught to read His word;   We are taught the way to heaven;   Praise for all to God be given. [Refrain]    3 Parents, teachers, old and young,   All unite to swell the song;   Higher and yet higher rise,   Till hosannas fill the skies. [Refrain]   Amen.

HYMN 838
1 Jesus, high in glory,   lend a listening ear;   when we bow before thee,   children's praises hear.    2 Though Thou art so holy,   heaven's almighty King,   thou wilt stoop to listen   when thy praise we sing.    3 We are little children,   weak and apt to stray;   Saviour, guide and keep us   in the heavenly way.    4 Save us, Lord, from sinning;   watch us day by day;   help us now to love thee;   take our sins away.    5 Then, when thou shalt call us   to our heavenly home,   we will gladly answer:   Saviour, Lord, we come!

HYMN 839
1 Theres a Friend for little children   above the bright blue sky,   a Friend who never changes,   whose love will never die;   our earthly friends may fail us,   and change with changing years;   this Friend is always worthy   of that dear name he bears.    2 Theres a rest for little children   above the bright blue sky,   who love the blessèd Saviour,   and to the Father cry:   a rest from every turmoil,   from sin and sorrow free,   where every little pilgrim   shall rest eternally.    3 Theres a home for little children   above the bright blue sky,   where Jesus reigns in glory,   a home of peace and joy:   no home on earth is like it,   nor can with it compare;   for everyone is happy,   nor could be happier, there.   * 4 Theres a crown for little children   above the bright blue sky,   and all who look for Jesus   shall wear it by and by;   a crown of brightest glory,   which he will then bestow   on those who found his favour   and loved his name below.    5 Theres a song for little children   above the bright blue sky,   a song that will not weary,   though sung continually;   a song which even angels   can never, never sing;   they know not Christ as Saviour,   but worship him as King.    6 Theres a robe for little children   above the bright blue sky;   and a harp of sweetest music,   and palms of victory.   All, all above is treasured,   and found in Christ alone:   Lord, grant thy little children   to know thee as their own.     Source: CPWI Hymnal # 670

HYMN 84
1 All glory, laud, and honor   to you, Redeemer, King,   to whom the lips of children   made sweet hosannas ring.   You are the King of Israel   and David's royal Son,   now in the Lord's name coming,   the King and Blessed One.    2 The company of angels   is praising you on high;   and we with all creation   in chorus make reply.   The people of the Hebrews   with palms before you went;   our praise and prayer and anthems   before you we present.    3 To you before your passion   they sang their hymns of praise;   to you, now high exalted,   our melody we raise.   As you received their praises,   accept the prayers we bring,   for you delight in goodness,   O good and gracious King!   Psalter Hymnal, (Gray)

1 Hushed was the evening hymn,   the temple courts were dark;   the lamp was burning dim   before the sacred ark;   when suddenly a Voice Divine   rang through the silence of the shrine.    2 The old man, meek and mild,   the priest of Israel, slept;   his watch the Temple child,   the little Levite, kept;   and what from Eliï¿½s sense was sealed   the Lord to Hannahï¿½s son revealed.    3 Oh! give me Samuelï¿½s ear,   the open ear, O Lord,   alive and quick to hear   each whisper of thy word;   like him to answer at yhy call,   and to obey thee first of all.    4 Oh! give me Samuelï¿½s heart,   a lowly heart, that waits   where in thy house thou art,   or watches at thy gates;   ny day and night, a heart that still   moves at the breathing of thy will.    5 Oh! give me Samuelï¿½s mind,   a sweet unmurmuring faith,   obedient and resigned   to thee in life and death;   that I may read with child-like eyes   truths that are hidden from the wise.

1 It is a thing most wonderful,   almost too wonderful to be,   that God's own Son should come from heav'n,   and die to save a child like me.    2 And yet I know that it is true:   He chose a poor and humble lot,   and wept and toiled and mourned and died   for love of those who loved Him not.    3 I cannot tell how He could love   a child so weak and full of sin;   His love must be most wonderful   if He could die my love to win.    4 I sometimes think about the cross,   and shut my eyes, and try to see   the cruel nails and crown of thorns,   and Jesus crucified for me.    5 But even could I see Him die,   I could but see a little part   of that great love which, like a fire,   is always burning in His heart.    6 It is most wonderful to know   His love for me so free and sure;   but 'tis more wonderful to see   my love for Him so faint and poor.    7 And yet I want to love Thee, Lord;   O light the flame within my heart,   and I will love Thee more and more,   until I see Thee as Thou art.

I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky   and stay by my side until morning is nigh.    3 Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay   close by me forever, and love me, I pray.   Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,   and fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there.       Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 230

1 Wise men seeking Jesus,   Traveled from afar,   Guided on their journey   By a beauteous star.   But if we desire him,   He is close at hand;   For our native country   Is our Holy Land.    2 Prayerful souls may find him   By our quiet lakes,   Meet him on our hillsides   When the morning breaks.   In our fertile cornfields   While the sheaves are bound,   In our busy markets   Jesus may be found.    3 Every peaceful village   In our land might be,   Made by Jesus' presence   Like sweet Bethany.   He is more than near us,   If we love him well;   For he seeketh ever   In our hearts to dwell.     Source: The Hymnal for Boys and Girls # 40

1 The shepherds had an angel,   The Wise Men had a star,   But what have I, a little child,   To guide me home from far,   Where glad stars sing together,   And singing angels are?    2 Those shepherds, through the lonely night,   Sat watching by their sheep,   Until they saw the heavenly host   Who neither tire nor sleep,   All singing "Glory, glory"   In festival they keep.    3 Lord Jesus is my Guardian,   So I can nothing lack;   The lambs lie in His bosom   Along life's dangerous track:   The willful lambs that go astray   He, bleeding, fetches back.    4 Lord, bring me nearer day by day,   Till I my voice unite,   And sing my "Glory, glory,"   With angels clad in white,   All "Glory, glory," given to Thee,   Through all the heavenly height.   Amen.     Source: The Hymnal # 448

1 Remember all the people   Who live in far=off lands,   In strange and lovely cities,   Or roam the desert sands.   Remember all the children   Who yet have never heard   The truth that comes from Jesus,   The glory of His Word.    2 God bless the men and women   Who serve Him over sea;   God raise up more to help them,   To set the nations free,   Till all the distant people   In every foreign place   Shall understand His kingdom   And come into His grace.

1 I think when I read that sweet story of old,   When Jesus was here among men,   How He called little children as lambs to His fold,   I should like to have been with them then.   Refrain:   I should like to have been with them then,   I should like to have been with them then;   How He called little children as lambs to His fold,   I should like to have been with them then.    2 I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,   That His arm had been thrown around me;   And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,   "Let the little ones come unto Me."   Refrain:   "Let the little ones come unto Me,   Let the little ones come unto Me;"   And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,   "Let the little ones come unto Me."    3 Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go,   And ask for a share in His love;   And if I now earnestly seek Him below,   I shall see Him and hear Him above.   Refrain:   I shall see Him and hear Him above,   I shall see Him and hear Him above;   And if I now earnestly seek Him below,   I shall see Him and hear Him above.    4 In that beautiful place He has gone to prepare,   For all who are washed and forgiven;   And many dear children are gathering there,   For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven."   Refrain:   For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven,"   For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven;"   And many dear children are gathering there,   For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven."

HYMN 866
1 When mothers of Salem   Their children brought to Jesus,   The stern disciples drove them back   And bade them depart;   But Jesus saw them ere they fled,   And sweetly smiled, and kindly said,   "Suffer little children   To come unto Me.    2 "For I will receive them   And fold them in my bosom;   I'll be a shepherd to these lambs,   O drive them not away;   For, if their hearts to Me they give,   They shall with Me in glory live:   Suffer little children   To come unto Me."    3 How kind was our Savior   To bid these children welcome!   But there are many thousands   Who have never heard His name;   The Bible they have never read;   They know not that the Savior said,   "Suffer little children   To come unto Me."    4 O soon may the heathen   Of every tribe and nation   Fulfill Thy blessed word,   And cast their idols all away;   O shine upon them from above,   And show Thyself a God of love;   Teach the little children   To come unto Thee.

1 God of our fathers, known of old,   Lord of our far-flung battle line,   Beneath whose awful hand we hold   Dominion over palm and pine:   Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,   Lest we forget, lest we forget!    2 The tumult and the shouting dies;   The captains and the kings depart;   Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,   An humble and a contrite heart:   Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,   Lest we forget, lest we forget!    3 Far called our navies melt away.   On dune and headland sinks the fire;   Lo, all our pomp of yesterday   Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!   Judge of the nations, spare us yet,   Lest we forget, lest we forget!    4 If, drunk with sight of power, we loose   Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,   Such boasting as the Gentiles use   Or lesser breeds without the law:   Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,   Lest we forget, lest we forget!    5 For heathen heart that puts her trust   In reeking tube and iron shard;   All valiant dust that builds on dust,   And guarding calls not Thee to guard:   For frantic boast and foolish word,   Thy mercy on Thy people, Lord!

1 King of the city splendid,   Eternal in the height,   May all our country's cities   Be holy in Thy sight:   Cleansed from the deeds of darkness   Cities of light.    2 Inspire the sons of labour,   That honest toil may be   Their token, in life's hardness,   Of loyalty to Thee.   That Thou mayst in their hand-work   Love's heart-work see.    3 Teach love to gladden children   Who know not childhood's mirth,   Wronged of their rights no beauty   In their scant reach of earth:   To hope's large sunshine give them   A second birth.    4 Lord, end the spell of passion,   Break Thou the drunkard's lure:   Thou art the one Physician   The human heart to cure;   The wavering will to strengthen,   Foul life make pure.    5 Soon may our country's cities   Thy robe of glory wear:   Each place of toil a temple,   Each house a home of prayer:   Each city's name of beauty   The Lord is There!

1 Eternal Ruler of the ceaseless round   of circling planets singing on their way;   guide of the nations from the night profound   into the glory of the perfect day;   rule in our hearts, that we may ever be   guided and strengthened and upheld by thee. 2 We are of thee, the children of thy love,   the brothers of thy well-belov√®d Son;   descend, O Holy Spirit, like a dove,   into our hearts, that we may be as one:   as one with thee, to whom we ever tend;   as one with him, our Brother and our Friend. 3 We would be one in hatred of all wrong,   one in our love of all things sweet and fair,   one with the joy that breaketh into song,   one with the grief that trembles into prayer,   one in the power that makes thy children free   to follow truth, and thus to follow thee. 4 O clothe us with thy heavenly armour, Lord,   thy trusty shield, thy sword of love divine;   our inspiration be thy constant word;   we ask no victories that are not thine:   give or withhold, let pain or pleasure be;   enough to know that we are serving thee.

1 Once to every man and nation   Comes the moment to decide,   In the strife of truth with falsehood,   For the good or evil side;   Some great cause, God's new Messiah,   Offering each the bloom or blight,   And the choice goes by forever   Twixt that darkness and that light.    2 Then to side with truth is noble,   When we share her wretched crust,   Ere her cause bring fame and profit,   And 'tis prosperous to be just;   Then it is the brave man chooses   While the coward stands aside,   Till the multitude make virtue   Of the faith they had denied.    3 By the light of burning martyrs,   Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,   Toiling up new Calvaries ever   With the cross that turns not back;   New occasions teach new duties,   Time makes ancient good uncouth;   They must upward still and onward,   Who would keep abreast of truth.    4 Though the cause of evil prosper,   Yet 'tis truth alone is strong;   Though her portion be the scaffold,   And upon the throne be wrong:   Yet that scaffold sways the future,   And, behind the dim unknown,   Standeth God within the shadow   Keeping watch above His own.

1 Father, Who art alone   Our helper and our stay,   Oh, hear us as we plead   For loved ones far away,   And shield with thine almighty hand,   And shield with Thine almighty hand   Our travelers by sea and land.    2 For Thou, our Father God,   Art present everywhere,   And bendest low Thine ear   To catch the faintest pray'r,   Waiting rich blessings to bestow,   Waiting rich blessings to bestow   On all Thy children here below.    3 Oh, compass with Thy love   The daily path they tread;   And may Thy light and truth   Upon their hearts be shed,   That, one in all things with Thy will,   That, one in all things with Thy will,   Heavns peace and joy their souls may fill.    4 Guard them from every harm   When dangers shall assail,   And teach them that Thy pow'r   Can never, never fail;   We cannot with our loved ones be,   We cannot with our loved ones be,   But trust them, Father, unto Thee.    5 We all are travelers here   Along life's various road,   Meeting and parting oft   Till we shall mount to God,   At home at last with those we love,   At home at last, with those we love,   Within Thy heav'nly home above.

1 Eternal Father, strong to save,   Whose arm does bind the restless wave,   Who bids the mighty ocean deep   Its own appointed limits keep;   O hear us when we cry to Thee   For those in peril on the sea.    2 O Savior, whose almighty word   The winds and waves submissive heard,   Who walked upon the foaming deep,   And calm amid the rage did sleep;   O hear us when we cry to Thee   For those in peril on the sea.    3 O Holy Spirit, who did brood   Upon the waters dark and rude,   And bid their angry tumult cease,   And give for wild confusion peace;   O hear us when we cry to Thee   For those in peril on the sea.    4 O Trinity of love and pow'r,   Your children shield in danger's hour;   From rock and tempest, fire, and foe,   Protect them where-so-e'er they go;   Thus, evermore shall rise to Thee   Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.

1 O Love divine, that stooped to share   Our sharpest pang, our bitterest tear!   On Thee we cast each earth-born care;   We smile at pain while Thou art near.    2 Though long the weary way we tread,   And sorrow crown each lingering year,   No path we shun, no darkness dread,   Our hearts still whispering, "Thou art near!"    3 When drooping pleasure turns to grief,   And trembling faith is turned to fear,   The murmuring wind, the quivering leaf,   Shall softly tell us Thou art near!    4 On Thee we fling our burdening woe,   O Love divine, for ever dear!   Content to suffer, while we know,   Living and dying, Thou art near!   AMEN.     Source: The A.M.E. Zion Hymnal: official hymnal of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church # 459

1 Your hand, O Lord, in days of old   was strong to heal and save;   it triumphed over pain and death,   o'er darkness and the grave.   To you they came, the blind, the mute,   the paralyzed and lame,   the lepers in their misery,   the sick with fevered frame.    2 Your touch then, Lord, brought life and health,   gave speech and strength and sight;   and youth renewed and frenzy calmed   revealed you, Lord of light.   And now, O Lord, be near to bless,   almighty as before,   in crowded street, by beds of pain,   as by Gennes'ret's shore.    3 O be our great deliv'rer still,   the Lord of life and death;   restore and quicken, soothe and bless,   with your life-giving breath.   To hands that work and eyes that see   give wisdom's healing pow'r   that whole and sick and weak and strong   may praise you evermore.     Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal # 769

The arms of love that compass me   would all the world embrace.   Thee I shall constantly proclaim,   tho' earth and hell oppose;   bold to confess Thy glorious Name   before a world of foes.    3 His only righteousness I show,   His saving truth proclaim;   'tis all my business here below   to cry, "Behold the Lamb!"

1 Now the day is over,   night is drawing nigh;   shadows of the evening   steal across the sky.    2 Jesus, give the weary   calm and sweet repose;   with your tend'rest blessing   may my eyelids close.    3 Comfort ev'ry suff'rer   watching late in pain;   those who plan some evil,   from their sin restrain.    4 Thro' the long night-watches   may your angels spread   their bright wings above me,   watching round my bed.    5 When the morning wakens,   then may I arise   pure and fresh and sinless   in your holy eyes.

HYMN 948
1 Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;   the darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.   When other helpers fail and comforts flee,   Help of the helpless, O abide with me.    2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;   earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away.   Change and decay in all around I see.   O thou who changest not, abide with me.    3 I need thy presence every passing hour.   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?   Who like thyself my guide and strength can be?   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.    4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless,   ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.   Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?   I triumph still, if thou abide with me.    5 Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes.   Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.   Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee;   in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.   Lift Up Your Hearts,  2013

1 Behold us, Lord a little space   From daily tasks set free,   And met within Thy holy place   To rest awhile with Thee.    2 Around us rolls the ceaseless tide   Of business, toil, and care,   And scarcely can we turn aside   For one brief hour of prayer.    3 Yet these are not the only walls   Wherein Thou mayst be sought;   On homeliest work thy blessing falls   In truth and patience wrought.    4 Thine is the loom, the forge, the mart,   The wealth of land and sea;   The worlds of science and of art,   Revealed and ruled by Thee.    5 Then let us prove our heavenly birth   In all we do and know,   And claim the kingdom of the earth   For Thee, and not thy foe.    6 Work shall be prayer, if all be wrought   As thou wouldst have it done;   And prayer, by thee inspired and taught,   Itself with work be one.   AMEN.     Source: The A.M.E. Zion Hymnal: official hymnal of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church # 317

1 Jesus, Sun and Shield art Thou;   Sun and Shield for ever:   Never canst Thou cease to shine,   Cease to guard us never.   Cheer our steps as on we go,   Come between us and the foe.    2 Jesus, Bread and Wine art Thou,   Wine and Bread for ever:   Never canst Thou cease to feed,   Or refresh us never.   Feed we still on Bread Divine,   Drink we still this heavenly Wine.    3 Jesus, Love and Life art Thou,   Life and Love for ever:   Ne'er to quicken shalt Thou cease,   Or to love us never.   All of life or love we need   Is in Thee, in Thee indeed.    4 Jesus, Peace and Joy art Thou,   Joy and Peace for ever:   Joy that fades not, changes not,   Peace that leaves us never.   Joy and peace we have in Thee,   Now and through eternity.    5 Jesus, Song and Strength art Thou,   Strength and Song for ever:   Strength that never can decay,   Song that ceaseth never.   Still to us this strength and song   Through eternal days prolong.   Amen.   The Hymnal: Published by the authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.,  1895

1 Blest are the pure in heart,   for they shall see our God;   the secret of the Lord is theirs,   their soul is Christ's abode. 2 The Lord, who left the heavens   our life and peace to bring,   to dwell in lowliness with men,   their pattern and their King; 3 Still to the lowly soul   he doth himself impart,   and for his dwelling and his throne   chooseth the pure in heart. 4 Lord, we thy presence seek;   may ours this blessing be;   give us a pure and lowly heart,   a temple meet for thee.

1 Jesus, lover of my soul,   let me to thy bosom fly,   while the nearer waters roll,   while the tempest still is high;   hide me, O my Savior, hide,   till the storm of life is past;   safe into the haven guide,   O receive my soul at last!    2 Other refuge have I none;   hangs my helpless soul on thee;   leave, ah! leave me not alone,   still support and comfort me.   All my trust on thee is stayed,   all my help from thee I bring;   cover my defenseless head   with the shadow of thy wing.    3 Plenteous grace with thee is found,   grace to cover all my sin;   let the healing streams abound;   make and keep me pure within.   Thou of life the fountain art;   freely let me take of thee;   spring thou up within my heart,   rise to all eternity.   Psalter Hymnal,  1987

Thy blessing is endued with soothing power;   On human hearts worn out with toil, thy word   Falls soft and gentle as the evening shower.    3 Come then, O Lord, and deign to be our guest,   After the day's confusion, toil, and din;   Oh, come to bring us peace, and joy, and rest,   To give salvation, and to pardon sin!    4 Bind up the wounds, assuage the aching smart   Left in each bosom from the day just past,   And let us on a Father's loving heart   Forget our griefs, and find sweet rest at last.

1 Father, let me dedicate   all this year to thee,   in whatever worldly state   thou wilt have me be:   not from sorrow, pain or care   freedom dare I claim;   this alone shall be my prayer:   glorify thy name.    2 Can a child presume to choose   where or how to live?   Can a father's love refuse   all the best to give?   More thou givest every day   than the best can claim,   not withholdest aught that may   glorify your name.    3 If in mercy you prolong   Joys that now are mine,   If on life serene and fair   Brighter rays may shine,   Let my glad heart, while it sings,   You in all proclaim   and, whate'er the future brings,   glorify thy name.    4 If thou callest to the cross,   and its shadow come,   turning all my gain to loss,   shrouding heart and home;   let me think how thy dear Son   to his glory came,   and in deepest woe pray on,   'glorify thy name.'

God our Maker doth provide   for our wants to be supplied;   come to God's own temple, come,   raise the song of harvest home.    2 All the world is God's own field,   fruit as praise to God we yield;   wheat and tares together sown   are to joy or sorrow grown;   first the blade and then the ear,   then the full corn shall appear;   Lord of harvest, grant that we   wholesome grain and pure may be.    3 For the Lord our God shall come,   and shall take the harvest home;   from the field shall in that day   all offenses purge away,   giving angels charge at last   in the fire the tares to cast;   but the fruitful ears to store   in the garner evermore.    4 Even so, Lord, quickly come,   bring thy final harvest home;   gather thou thy people in,   free from sorrow, free from sin,   there, forever purified,   in thy presence to abide;   come, with all thine angels, come,   raise the glorious harvest home.

HYMN 97
1 Join all the glorious names   of wisdom, love, and pow'r,   that ever mortals knew,   that angels ever bore;   all are too mean to speak His worth,   too mean to set my Savior forth.    2 Great Prophet of my God,   my tongue would bless Thy Name;   by Thee the joyful news   of our salvation came-   the joyful news of sins forgiv'n,   of hell subdued, and peace with heav'n.    3 Jesus, my great High Priest,   offered His blood and died;   my guilty conscience seeks   no sacrifice beside:   His pow'rful blood did once atone,   and now it pleads before the throne.    4 My dear Almighty Lord,   my Conqueror and King,   Thy sceptre and Thy sword,   Thy reigning grace I sing;   Thine is the pow'r; behold I sit,   in willing bonds, beneath Thy feet.    5 Now let my soul arise,   and tread the tempter down;   my Captain leads me forth   to conquest and a crown.   A feeble saint shall win the day,   tho' death and hell obstruct the way.     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 317

1 Hear us, O Lord, from heaven Thy dwelling-place:   Like them of old, in vain we toil all night,   Unless with us Thou go, who art the Light;   Come then, O Lord, that we may see Thy face.    2 Thou, Lord, dost rule the raging of the sea,   When loud the storm and furious is the gale:   Strong is Thine arm; our little barques are frail:   Send us Thy help; remember Galilee.    3 Our wives and children we commend to Thee:   For them we plough the land and plough the deep;   For them by day the golden corn we reap,   By night the silver harvest of the sea.    4 We thank Thee, Lord, for sunshine, dew, and rain,   Broadcast from heaven by Thine almighty hand   Source of all life, unnumbered as the sand   Bird, beast, and fish, herb, fruit, and golden grain.    5 O Bread of Life, Thou in Thy Word hast said,   Who feeds in faith on Me shall never die!   In mercy hear Thy hungry children's cry,   Father, give us this day our daily bread!    6 Sow in our hearts the seeds of Thy dear love,   That we may reap contentment, joy, and peace;   And when at last our earthly labours cease,   Grant us to join Thy harvest home above.

1 Here, Lord, we offer Thee all that is fairest,   Bloom from the garden, and flowers from the field,   Gifts for the stricken ones, knowing Thou carest   More for the love than the wealth that we yield.    2 Speak, Lord, by these to the sick and the dying;   Speak to their hearts with a message of peace;   Comfort the sad, who in weakness are lying;   Grant the departing a gentle release.    3 Raise, Lord, to health again those who have sickened,   Fair be their lives as the roses in bloom;   Give of Thy grace to the souls Thou hast quickened,   Gladness for sorrow and brightness for gloom.    4 We, Lord, like flowers, must bloom and must wither;   We, like these blossoms, must fade and must die;   Gather us, Lord, to Thy bosom for ever,   Grant us a place in Thy home in the sky.

HYMN 973
1 Rejoice for a brother deceased;   Our loss is his infinite gain;   A soul out of prison released,   And freed from its bodily pain!   With songs let us follow his flight,   And mount with his spirit above;   Escaped to the mansions of light,   And lodged in the Eden of love.    2 Our brother the haven hath gained;   Outflying the tempest and wind,   His rest he hath sooner obtained,   And left his companions behind;   Still toss'd on a sea of distress;   Hard-toiling to make the blest shore,   Where all is assurance and peace,   And sorrow and sin are no more.    3 There all the ship's company meet,   Who sailed with the Saviour beneath;   With shouting each other they greet,   And triumph o'er sorrow and death:   The voyage of life's at an end,   The mortal affliction is past:   The age that in heaven they spend,   For ever and ever shall last.

HYMN 974
God of the living, in whose eyes   Unveiled thy whole creation lies,   All souls are thine; we must not say   That those are dead who pass away,   From this our world of flesh set free;   We know them living unto thee.   Released from earthly toil and strife,   With thee is hidden still their life;   Thine are their thoughts, their works, their powers,   All thine, and yet most truly ours,   For well we know, where'er they be,   Our dead are living unto thee.   Not spilt like water on the ground,   Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,   Not wandering in unknown despair   Beyond thy voice, thine arm, thy care;   Not left to lie like fallen tree;   Not dead, but living unto thee.   Thy word is true, thy will is just;   To thee we leave them, Lord, in trust;   And bless thee for the love which gave   Thy Son to fill a human grave,   That none might fear that world to see   Where all are living unto thee.    374   O Breather into man of breath,   O Holder of the keys of death,   O Giver of the life within,   Save us from death, the death of sin;   That body, soul, and spirit be   For ever living unto thee!   Amen.

1 When the day of toil is done,   When the race of life is run,   Father, grant Thy wearied one   Rest for evermore.    2 When the strife of sin is stilled,   When the foe within is killed,   Be Thy gracious word fulfilled,--   "Peace for evermore."    3 When the darkness melts away   At the breaking of the day,   Bid us hail the cheering ray,--   Light for evermore.    4 When the heart by sorrow tried   Feels at length its throbs subside,   Bring us, where all tears are dried,   Joy for evermore.    5 When for vanished days we yearn,   Days that never can return,   Teach us in Thy love to learn   Love for evermore.    6 When the breath of life is flown,   When the grave must claim its own,   Lord of life, be ours Thy crown,--   Life for evermore.

1 Safe Home, safe Home in port!   Rent cordage, shattered deck,   Torn sails, provisions short,   And only not a wreck:   But O the joy upon the shore   To tell our voyage perils oÂer!    2 The prize, the prize secure!   The warrior nearly fell;   Bare all he could endure,   And bare not always well:   But he may smile at troubles gone   Who sets the victor-garland on!    3 No more the foe can harm   No more of leaguer'd camp,   And cry of night alarm,   And need of ready lamp:   And yet how nearly he had fail'd,Â   How nearly had that foe prevail'd!    4 The lamb is in the fold   In perfect safety penn'd:   The lion once had hold,   And thought to make an end;   But One came by with wounded Side,   And for the sheep the Shepherd died.
