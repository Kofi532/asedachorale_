HYMN 1
1 Now that the daylight fills the sky,   we lift our hearts to God on high,   that he, in all we do or say,   would keep us free from harm today.    2 May he restrain our tongues from strife,   and shield from angers din our life,   and guard with watchful care our eyes   from earths absorbing vanities.    3 O may our inmost hearts be pure,   from thoughts of folly kept secure,   and pride of sinful flesh subdued   through sparing use of daily food.    4 So we, when this days work is oer,   and shades of night return once more,   our path of trial safely trod,   shall give the glory to our God.    5 All praise to God the Father be,   all praise, Eternal Son, to thee,   whom with the Spirit we adore   for ever and for evermore.

1 O God of truth, O Lord of might,   Who, ordering time and change aright,   Sendest the early morning ray,   Kindling the glow of perfect day;    2 Extinguish thou each sinful fire,   And banish every ill desire:   And, keeping all the body whole,   Shed forth Thy peace upon the soul.    3 O Father, that we ask be done,   Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son;   Who, with the Holy ghost and thee,   Shall live and reign eternally.

1. Sions daughter, weep no more,   Though thy troubled heart be sore;   He of whom the psalmist sung,   He who woke the prophets tongue,   Christ, the mediator blest,   Brings thee everlasting rest.    2. In a garden man became   Heir of sin, and death, and shame;   Jesus in a garden wins   Life, and pardon for our sins;   Through His hour of agony   Praying in Gethsemane.    3. There for us He intercedes;   There with God the Father pleads;   Willing there for us to drain   To the dregs the cup of pain,   That in everlasting day   He may wipe our tears away.    4. Therefore to His name be givn,   Glory both in earth and Heavn;   To the Father, and the Son,   And the Spirit, Three in One,   Honor, praise and glory be   Now and through eternity.

1. Oerwhelmed in depths of woe,   Upon the tree of scorn,   Hangs the Redeemer of mankind,   With racking anguish torn.    2. See how the nails those hands   And feet so tender rend;   See down His face, and neck, and breast   His sacred blood descend.    3. Oh, hear that last, loud cry   Which pierced His mothers heart,   As into God the Fathers hands   He bade His soul depart.    4. Earth hears, and trembling quakes   Around that tree of pain;   The rocks are rent; the graves are burst;   The veil is rent in twain.    5. Shall man alone be mute?   Have we no griefs, or fears?   Come, old and young, come, all mankind,   And bathe those feet in tears.    6. Come, fall before His cross,   Who shed for us His blood,   Who died, the victim of pure love,   To make us sons of God.    7.

1 He, Who once in righteous vengeance   Whelmed the world beneath the flood,   Once again in mercy cleansed it   With His own most precious blood;   Coming from His throne on high,   On the painful cross to die.    2 O the wisdom of the Eternal!   O its depth, and height divine!   O the sweetness of that mercy   Which in Jesus Christ did shine!   We were sinners doomed to die;   Jesus paid the penalty.    3 When before the Judge we tremble,   Conscious of His broken laws,   May the blood of His atonement   Cry aloud, and plead our cause;   Bid our guilty terrors cease,   Be our pardon and our peace.

1 Now my soul, thy voice upraising,   Tell in sweet and mournful strain   How the Crucified, enduring   Grief and wounds, and dying pain,   Freely of his love was offered,   Sinless was for sinners slain.    2 See, his hands and feet are fastened!   So he makes his people free;   Not a wound whence Blood is flowing   But a fount of grace shall be;   Yea, the very nails which nail him   Nail us also to the Tree.    3 Jesu, may those precious fountains   Drink to thirsting souls afford;   Let them be our cup and healing,   And at length our great reward:   So a ransomed world shall ever   Praise thee, its redeeming Lord.

1. O sinner, lift the eye of faith,   To true repentance turning;   Bethink thee of the curse of sin,   Its awful guilt discerning;   Upon the Crucified One look,   And thou shalt read, as in a book,   What well is worthy thy learning.    2. Look on His head, that bleeding head,   With crown of thorns surrounded;   Look on His sacred hands and feet   Which piercing nails have wounded;   See every limb with scourges rent:   On Him, the Just, the Innocent,   What malice hath abounded!    3. Tis not alone those limbs are racked,   But friends, too, are forsaking;   And, more than all, for thankless man   That tender heart is aching;   Oh, fearful was the pain and scorn,   By Jesus, Son of Mary, borne,   Their peace for sinners making.    4. None ever knew such pain before,   Such infinite affliction,   None ever felt a grief like His   In that dread crucifixion;   For us He bare those bitter throes,   For us those agonizing woes,   In oft renewed infliction.    5. O sinner, mark, and ponder well   Sins awful condemnation;   Think what a sacrifice it cost   To purchase Thy salvation;   Had Jesus never bled and died,   Then what could thee and all betide   But uttermost damnation?    6. Lord, give us grace to flee from sin,   And Satans wiles ensnaring,   And from those everlasting flames   For evil ones preparing.

1 My God, I love Thee, not because   I hope for heav'n thereby,   nor yet for fear that, loving not,   I might forever die.   But for that Thou didst all mankind   upon the cross embrace;   for us didst bear the nails and spear,   and manifold disgrace;    2 And griefs and torments numberless,   and sweat of agony,   e'en death itself, and all for man,   who was Thine enemy.   Then why, most loving Jesus Christ,   should I not love Thee well?   Not for the sake of winning heav'n,   nor any fear of hell;    3 Not with the hope of gaining aught,   nor seeking a reward,   but as Thyself hast loved me,   O ever-loving Lord!

1 When I survey the wondrous cross   on which the Prince of glory died,   my richest gain I count but loss,   and pour contempt on all my pride.    2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast   save in the death of Christ, my God!   All the vain things that charm me most,   I sacrifice them through his blood.    3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet,   sorrow and love flow mingled down.   Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,   or thorns compose so rich a crown?    4 Were the whole realm of nature mine,   that were a present far too small.   Love so amazing, so divine,   demands my soul, my life, my all.   Psalter Hymnal,  1987

1 At the cross her station keeping,   Stood the mournful Mother weeping,   Close to Jesus to the last.    2 Through her heart, his sorrow sharing,   All his bitter anguish bearing,   Now at length the sword has passed.    3 O how sad and sore distressed,   Was that Mother highly blest   Of the sole begotten One!    4 Christ above in torment hangs,   She beneath beholds the pangs   Of her dying, glorious Son.    5 Is there one who would not weep,   Whelmed in miseries so deep,   Christ's dear Mother to behold?    6 Can the human heart refrain   From partaking in her pain,   In that Mother's pain untold?    7 Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,   She beheld her tender Child,   All with bloody scourges rent.    8 For the sins of his own nation   Saw him hang in desolation   Till his spirit forth he sent.    9 O thou Mother!

1 O Father, Thou whose love profound   a ransom for our souls hath found,   before Thy throne we sinners bend;   to us Thy pard'ning love extend.    2 Almighty Son, Incarnate Word,   our Prophet, Priest, Redeemer, Lord,   before Thy throne we sinners bend;   to us Thy saving grace extend.    3 Eternal Spirit, by whose breath   the soul is raised from sin and death,   before Thy throne we sinners bend;   to us Thy quick'ning pow'r extend.    4 Jehovah! Father, Spirit, Son,   mysterious Godhead, Three in One,   before Thy throne we sinners bend;   grace, pardon, life, to us extend.     Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God # 182

1 O God, our Help in ages past,   our Hope for years to come,   our Shelter from the stormy blast,   and our eternal Home.    2 Under the shadow of Thy throne   Thy saints have dwelt secure;   sufficient is Thine arm alone,   and our defense is sure.    3 Before the hills in order stood,   or earth received its frame,   from everlasting Thou art God,   to endless years the same.    4 A thousand ages in Thy sight   are like an evening gone,   short as the watch that ends the night   before the rising sun.    5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream   bears all its sons away;   they fly forgotten, as a dream   dies at the opÂ’ning day.    6 O God, our Help in ages past,   our Hope for years to come,   be Thou our Guard while life shall last,   and our eternal Home!

1 O worship the King all-glorious above,   O gratefully sing his power and his love:   our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days,   pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.    2 O tell of his might and sing of his grace,   whose robe is the light, whose canopy space.   His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,   and dark is his path on the wings of the storm.    3 Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite?   It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;   it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,   and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.    4 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,   in you do we trust, nor find you to fail.   Your mercies, how tender, how firm to the end,   our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!    5 O measureless Might, unchangeable Love,   whom angels delight to worship above!   Your ransomed creation, with glory ablaze,   in true adoration shall sing to your praise!   Psalter Hymnal, (Gray)

1 There is a book that all may read,   Which heavenly truth imparts;   And all the lore its scholars need,   And all the lore its scholars need,   Pure eyes and Christian hearts.    2 The works of God above, below,   Within us, and around,   Are pages in that book, to show   How God himself is found.    3 The glorious sky, embracing all,   Is like the Maker's love,   Wherewith encompassed, great and small,   In peace and order move.    4 The dew of heaven is like thy grace,   It steals in silence down;   But where it falls, the favored place   By richest fruits is known.    5 Thou who has given me eyes to see,   And love for what is fair,   Give me a heart to find out thee,   And read thee everywhere.

1 My God, how wonderful Thou art,   Thy majesty how bright,   How beautiful Thy mercy seat,   in depths of burning light!    2 How dread are Thine eternal years,   O everlasting LORD;   by prostrate spirits, day and night,   incessantly adored.    3 How wonderful, how beautiful,   the sight of Thee must be,   Thine endless wisdom, boundless pow'r,   and awful purity.    4 O how I fear Thee, Living God,   with deepest, tend'rest fears,   and worship Thee with trembling hope,   and penitential tears.    5 Yet I may love Thee too, O LORD,   Almighty as Thou art;   for Thou hast stooped to ask of me   the love of my poor heart.    6 No earthly father loves like Thee,   no mother eÂ’er so mild,   bears and forbears, as Thou hast done   with me, Thy sinful child.    7 Father of Jesus, love's reward,   what rapture will it be,   prostrate before Thy throne to lie,   and ever gaze on Thee!

1 The sun is sinking fast,   the daylight dies;   let love awake, and pay   her evening sacrifice.    2 As Christ upon the cross   his head inclined,   and to his Father's hands   his parting soul resigned,    3 so now herself my soul   would wholly give   into his sacred charge,   in whom all spirits live;    4 so now beneath his eye   would calmly rest,   without a wish or thought   abiding in the breast,    5 save that his will be done,   whate'er betide;   dead to herself, and dead   in him to all beside.    6 Thus would I live: yet now   not I, but he,   in all his power and love   henceforth alive in me.    7 One sacred Trinity!   One Lord divine!   May I be ever his,   and he for ever mine.     Source: CPWI Hymnal # 29

1 Jesus is God! the solid earth,   The ocean broad and bright,   The countless stars, like golden dust   That strew the skies at night;   The wheeling storm, the dreadful fire,   The pleasant, wholesome air,   The summer's sun, the winter's frost,   His own creations were.    2 Jesus is God! the glorious bands   Of golden angels sing   Songs of adoring praise to Him,   Their Maker and their King.   He was true God in Bethlehem's crib,   On Calvary's Cross true God;   He who in heaven eternal reigned,   In time on earth abode.    3 Jesus is God! there never was   A time when He was not:   Boundless, eternal, merciful,   The Word the Sire begot!   Backward our thoughts through ages stretch,   Onward through endless bliss,--   For there are two eternities,   And both alike are His!    4 Jesus is God! let sorrow come,   And pain, and every ill;   All are worth while, for all are means   His glory to fulfil!   Worth while a thousand years of life   To speak one little word,   If by our Credo we might own   The Godhead of our Lord!    5 Jesus is God! if on the earth   This blessed faith decays,   More tender must our love become,   More plentiful our praise;   We are not angels, but we may   Down in earth's corners kneel,   And multiply sweet acts of love,   And murmur what we feel.

1 Praise to the Holiest in the height,   and in the depth be praise:   in all his words most wonderful,   most sure in all his ways.    2 O loving wisdom of our God!   When all was sin and shame,   a second Adam to the fight   and to the rescue came.    3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood,   which did in Adam fail,   should strive afresh against the foe,   should strive and should prevail;    4 And that a higher gift than grace   should flesh and blood refine,   God's presence and his very self,   and essence all-divine.    5 O generous love! that he, who smote   in Man for man the foe,   the double agony in Man   for man should undergo;    6 And in the garden secretly,   and on the cross on high,   should teach his brethren, and inspire   to suffer and to die.    7 Praise to the Holiest in the height,   and in the depth be praise:   in all his words most wonderful,   most sure in all his ways.

1 O love, how deep, how broad, how high,   how passing thought and fantasy,   that God, the Son of God, should take   our mortal form for mortals sake!    2 He sent no angel to our race,   of higher or of lower place,   but wore the robe of human frame,   and He Himself to this world came.    3 For us baptized, for us He bore   His holy fast, and hungered sore;   for us temptations sharp He knew,   for us the tempter overthrew.    4 For us to wicked men betrayed,   scourged, mocked, in crown of thorns arrayed,   He bore the shameful cross and death   for us at length gave up His breath.    5 For us He rose from death again,   for us He went on high to reign,   for us He sent His Spirit here   to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.    6 All glory to our Lord and God   for love so deep, so high, so broad   the Trinity whom we adore   forever and forevermore.

1 Conquering kings their titles take   from the lands they captive make;   Jesus, from a nobler deed,   from the thousands he hath freed.    2 Yes: none other name is given   unto mortals under heaven,   which can make the dead arise   and exalt them to the skies.    3 That which Christ so hardly wrought,   that which he so dearly bought,   that salvation, brethren say,   shall we madly cast away?    4 Rather gladly for that name   bear the cross, endure the shame;   joyfully for him to die   is not death but victory.    5 Jesu, who dost condescend   to be called the sinnerÂ’s friend,   hear us, as to thee we pray,   glorying in thy name today.    6 Glory to the Father be,   glory, Holy Son, to thee,   glory to the Holy Ghost,   from the saints and angel-host.

How good to them for sin that mourn!   To them that seek thee, O how kind!   But what art thou to them that find?    4 Jesu, thou sweetness, pure and blest,   TruthÂ’s fountain, Light of souls distrest,   Surpassing all that heart requires,   Exceeding all that soul desires!    5 No tongue of mortal can express,   No letters write its blessedness:   Alone who hath thee in his heart   Knows, love of Jesus, what thou art.    6 *I seek for Jesus in repose,   When round my heart its chambers close;   Abroad, and when I shut the door,   I long for Jesus evermore.    7 *With Mary in the morning gloom   I seek for Jesus at the tomb;   For him with love's most earnest cry,   I seek with heart and not with eye.    8 *Jesus, to God the Father gone,   Is seated on the heavenly throne;   My heart hath also passed from me,   That where he is there it may be.    9 We follow Jesus now, and raise   The voice of prayer, the hymn of praise,   That He at last may make us meet   With him to gain the heavenly seat.

1 You are the way; thro' you alone   can we the Father find;   in you, O Christ, has God revealed   his heart and will and mind.    2 You are the truth; your Word alone   true wisdom can impart;   you only can inform the mind   and purify the heart.    3 You are the life; the empty tomb   proclaims your conqu'ring arm,   and those who put their trust in you   nor death nor hell shall harm.    4 You are the way, the truth, the life;   grant us that way to know,   that truth to keep, that life to win,   whose joys eternal flow.

1 O Jesus, Lord of heavenly grace,   thou brightness of thy Father's face,   thou fountain of eternal light,   whose beams disperse the shades of night.    2 Come, holy Sun of heavenly love,   shower down thy radiance from above,   and to our inward hearts convey   the Holy Spirit's cloudless ray.    3 May faith, deep-rooted in the soul,   subdue our flesh, our minds control;   may guile depart and discord cease,   and all within be joy and peace.    4 O hallowed be the approaching day;   let meekness be our morning ray,   and faithful love our noonday light,   and hope our sunset calm and bright.    5 O Christ, with each returning morn,   thine image to our hearts is borne;   oh may we ever clearly see   our Saviour and our God in thee.

1 At even, ere the sun was set,   the sick, O Lord, around thee lay;   O in what divers pains they met!   O with what joy they went away! 2 Once more 'tis eventide, and we   oppressed with various ills draw near;   what if thy form we cannot see?   we know and feel that thou art here. 3 O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel;   for some are sick, and some are sad,   and some have never loved thee well,   and some have lost the love they had; 4 And some have found the world is vain,   yet from the world they break not free;   and some have friends who give them pain,   yet have not sought a friend in thee; 5 And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,   for none are wholly free from sin;   and they who fain would serve thee best   are conscious most of wrong within. 6 O Saviour Christ, thou too art man;   thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;   thy kind but searching glance can scan   the very wounds that shame would hide. 7 Thy touch has still its ancient power;   no word from thee can fruitless fall:   Hear, in this solemn evening hour,   and in thy mercy heal us all.

1 We sing the praise of him who died,   of him who died upon the cross;   the sinner's hope let men deride,   for this we count the world but loss.    2 Inscribed upon the cross we see   in shining letters, 'God is love';   he bears our sins upon the tree;   he brings us mercy from above.    3 The cross! It takes our guilt away:   it holds the fainting spirit up;   it cheers with hope the gloomy day,   and sweetens every bitter cup.    4 It makes the coward spirit brave,   and nerves the feeble arm for fight;   it takes its terror from the grave,   and gilds the bed of death with light:    5 The balm of life, the cure of woe,   the measure and the pledge of love,   the sinner's refuge here below,   the angels' theme in heaven above.

1 Where high the heavenly temple stands,   the house of God not made with hands,   a great High-Priest our nature wears,   the guardian of mankind appears.    2 He who for men their surety stood,   and poured on earth his precious blood,   pursues in heaven his mighty plan,   the Saviour and the friend of man.    3 Though now ascended up on high,   he bends on earth a brother's eye;   partaker of the human name,   he knows the frailty of our frame.    4 Our fellow-suff'rer yet retains   a fellow-feeling of our pains;   and still remembers in the skies   his tears, his agonies, and cries.    5 In every pang that rends the heart   the Man of Sorrows had a part;   he sympathizes with our grief,   and to the sufferer sends relief.    6 With boldness therefore at the throne,   let us make all our sorrows known;   and ask the aid of heavenly power   to help us in the evil hour.

One holy name she blesses,   partakes one holy food,   and to one hope she presses,   with every grace endued.    3 Though with a scornful wonder,   men see her sore oppressed,   by schisms rent asunder,   by heresies distressed,   yet saints their watch are keeping,   their cry goes up, "How long?"   and soon the night of weeping   shall be the morn of song!    4 The church shall never perish!   Her dear Lord to defend,   to guide, sustain, and cherish,   is with her to the end;   though there be those that hate her,   and false sons in her pale,   against the foe or traitor   she ever shall prevail.    5 'Mid toil and tribulation,   and tumult of her war,   she waits the consummation   of peace forevermore;   till with the vision glorious   her longing eyes are blest,   and the great church victorious   shall be the church at rest.    6 Yet she on earth hath union   with God the Three in One,   and mystic sweet communion   with those whose rest is won;   O happy ones and holy!

1 For thee, O dear country,   Mine eyes their vigils keep;   For very love beholding   Thy holy name, they weep.   The mention of thy glory   Is unction to the breast,   And medicine in sickness,   And love, and life, and rest    2 O one, O only mansion!   O Paradise of joy!   Where tears are ever banishd   And smiles have no alloy;   Thy loveliness oppresses   All human thought and heart,   And none, O Peace, O SIon,   Can sing thee as thou art.    3 With jasper glow thy bulwarks,   Thy streets with emeralds blaze;   The sardius and the topaz   Unite in thee their rays;   Thine ageless walls are bonded   With amethyst unpriced;   The saints shall build thy fabric,   And the cornerstone is Christ.    4 The cross is all thy splendor,   The Crucified thy praise;   His laud and benediction   Thy ransomd saints shall raise;   Upon the Rock of Ages   They build thy holy tower;   Thine is the victor's laurel,   And thine the golden dower.    5 O sweet and blessed country,   The home of Gods elect!   O sweet and blessed country   That eager hearts expect!   Jesus, in mercy bring us   To that dear land of rest,   Who art, with God the Father,   And Spirit, ever blest.

1 Jerusalem the golden,   with milk and honey blest,   beneath your contemplation   sink heart and voice oppressed;   I know not, O I know not   what joys await me there,   what radiancy of glory,   what bliss beyond compare!    2 They stand, those halls of Zion,   all jubilant with song,   and bright with many an angel,   and all the martyr throng;   the Prince is ever in them;   the daylight is serene;   the pastures of the blessed   are decked in glorious sheen.    3 There is the throne of David;   and there, from care released,   the shout of those who triumph,   the song of those who feast;   and they, who with their Leader   have conquered in the fight,   forever and forever   are clad in robes of white.    4 O sweet and blessed country,   the home of God's elect!   O sweet and blessed country,   that eager hearts expect!   In mercy, Jesus, bring us   to that dear land of rest,   who are, with God the Father,   and Spirit, ever blessed.

1 The roseate hues of early dawn,   The brightness of the day,   The crimson of the sunset sky,   How fast they fade away!   O for the pearly gates of heav'n!   O for the golden floor!   O for the Sun of Righteousness   That setteth nevermore!    2 The highest hopes we cherish here,   How fast they tire and faint!   How many a spot defiles the robe   That wraps an earthly saint!   O for a heart that never sins!   O for a soul washed white!   O for a voice to praise our King,   Nor weary day or night!    3 Here faith is ours, and heavenly hopes,   And grace to lead us higher:   But there are perfectness and peace   Beyond our great desire.   O by Thy love and anguish, Lord,   O by Thy life laid down,   O that we fall not from Thy grace,   Nor cast away our crown!   Amen.       Source: The Hymnal and Order of Service # 513

1 There is a blessed home beyond this land of woe,   Where trials never come, nor tears of sorrow flow;   Where faith is fully lost in sight, and patient hope is crowned,   And everlasting light its glory casts around.    2 There is a land of peace, good angels know it well;   Glad songs that never cease within its portals swell.   Around the glorious throne of God the countless saints adore   Christ, with the Father one, and Spirit evermore.    3 O joy all joys beyond, to see the Lamb who died,   And count each sacred wound in hands and feet and side;   To give to him eternal praise for evÂ’ry triumph won,   And sing through endless days the great things he has done!    4 Look up, you saints of God, nor fear to tread below   The path your Savior trod of daily toil and woe:   Wait only for a little while in uncomplaining love.   His own most gracious smile will welcome you above.     Source: Christian Worship ( 2008): supplement # 729

1 I heard the voice of Jesus say,   Come unto Me and rest;   lay down, thou weary one, lay down   thy head upon My breast.   I came to Jesus as I was,   so weary, worn, and sad;   I found in Him a resting place,   and He has made me glad.    2 I heard the voice of Jesus say,   Behold, I freely give   the living water, thirsty one;   stoop down, and drink, and live.   I came to Jesus, and I drank   of that life-giving stream;   my thirst was quenched, my soul revived,   and now I live in Him.    3 I heard the voice of Jesus say,   I am this dark worlds Light;   look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,   and all thy day be bright.   I looked to Jesus, and I found   in Him my Star, my Sun;   and in that Light of life Ill walk,   till trav'ling days are done.

1 I was a wand'ring sheep,   I did not love the fold;   I did not love my Shepherd's voice,   I would not be controlled.   I was a wayward child,   I did not love my home;   I did not love my Father's voice,   I loved afar to roam.    2 The Shepherd sought his sheep,   the Father sought his child;   they followed me o'er vale and hill,   o'er deserts waste and wild:   they found me nigh to death,   famished and faint and lone;   they bound me with the bands of love,   they saved the wand'ring one.    3 Jesus my Shepherd is;   'twas he that loved my soul,   'twas he that washed me in his blood,   'twas he that made me whole;   'twas he that sought the lost,   that found the wand'ring sheep,   'twas he that brought me to the fold,   'tis he that still doth keep.    4 I was a wand'ring sheep,   I would not be controlled;   but now I love my Shepherd's voice,   I love, I love the fold.   I was a wayward child,   I once preferred to roam;   but now I love my Father's voice,   I love, I love his home.       Source: Trinity Hymnal (Rev. ed.) # 464

Who like thyself my guide and strength can be?   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.    4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless,   ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.

Praise the Lord! for he has spoken;   Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;   Laws which never shall be broken   For their guidance he has made.    2 Praise the Lord! for he is glorious;   Never shall his promise fail;   God has made his saints victorious;   Sin and death shall not prevail.   Praise the God of our salvation!   Hosts on high his pow'r proclaim;   Heav'n, and earth, and all creation,   Laud and magnify his name.    3 Worship, honor, glory, blessing,   Lord, we offer unto thee;   Young and old, thy praise expressing,   In glad homage bend the knee.   All the saints in heav'n adore thee,   We would bow before thy throne;   As thine angels serve before thee,   So on earth thy will be done.     Source: Breaking Bread (Vol.  39) # 533

1 O praise our great and gracious Lord,   and call upon his name;   to strains of joy tune every chord,   his mighty acts proclaim;   tell how he led his chosen race   to Canaans promised land;   tell how his covenant of grace   unchanged shall ever stand.    2 He gave the shadowing cloud by day,   the moving fire by night;   to guide his Israel on their way,   he made their darkness light;   and have we not a sure retreat,   a Saviour ever nigh,   the same clear light to guide our feet,   the day-spring from on high?    3 We too, have manna from above,   the bread that comes from heaven;   to us the same kind hand of love   hath living waters given;   a rock we have, from whence the spring   in rich abundance flows;   that rock is Christ, our Priest, our King,   who life and health bestows.    4 O may we praise this blessèd food,   and trust our heavenly Guide;   so shall we find death's fearful flood   serene as Jordan's tide,   and safely reach that happy shore,   and land of peace and rest,   where angels worship and adore   in Gods own presence blest.

HYMN 297
1 Songs of praise the angels sang,   heaven with alleluias rang,   when creation was begun,   when God spake and it was done. 2 Songs of praise awoke the morn   when the Prince of peace was born;   songs of praise arose when he   captive led captivity. 3 Heaven and earth must pass away;   songs of praise shall crown that day:   God will make new heavens and earth;   songs of praise shall hail their birth. 4 And shall we alone be dumb   till that glorious kingdom come?   No, the church delights to raise   psalms and hymns and songs of praise. 5 Saints below, with heart and voice,   still in songs of praise rejoice;   learning here, by faith and love,   songs of praise to sing above. 6 Hymns of glory, songs of praise,   Father, unto thee we raise,   Jesu, glory unto thee,   with the Spirit, ever be.

1 I am not worthy, Holy Lord,   that thou shouldst come to me;   speak but the word; one gracious word   can set the sinner free.    2 I am not worthy; cold and bare   the lodging of my soul;   how canst thou deign to enter there?   Lord, speak, and make me whole.    3 I am not worthy; yet, my God,   how can I say thee nay;   thee, who didst give thy flesh and blood   my ransom price to pay?    4 O come! in this sweet morning hour   feed me with food divine;   and fill with all thy love and power   this wavering heart of mine.

Great Shepherd, take it to Thy fold,   Thine own for aye to be:   Defend it through this earthly strife,   And lead it in the path of life.    3 O Spirit, brooding o'er the wave,   Descend upon this child:   Give endless life, its spirit lave   With waters undefiled:   Grant it a child of God to be,   A holy temple unto Thee.    4 O God, Thine own command is done:   We speak, but Thine the might:   This child which scarce hath seen the sun,   O pour on it Thy light,   In faith and hope, in joy and love,   Thou Sun of all, below, above!

Substitute she/her for he/him if appropriate.    1. Within the Churchs sacred fold,   By holy sacrament enrolled,   Another lamb we lay:   An heir before of sin and shame,   Now in the holy triune name   His guilt is washed away.    2. O loving Father, Thee we pray   Look on this babe newborn today,   Thine own adopted child;   An angel guard do Thou bestow   To lead him in Thy paths below,   And guide him through the wild.    3. O God the Son, Thou heavenly vine,   Protect this tender branch of Thine   Through all that may betide;   Forever nourished may he be   With sap divine that flows from Thee,   In Thee for aye abide.    4. Blest Spirit, whose indwelling grace   Has given this little one a place   Among the heirs of life;   O breathe Thy sevenfold gifts within,   And keep Thy temple pure from sin   In midst of worldly strife.    5. So, holy Trinity, by Thee   Divinely trained this babe may be   In faith and hope and love;   So may he gain, earths waves oerpast,   His bright inheritance at last   With all Thy saints above.

1. Tis done! that new and heavenly birth,   Which re-creates the sons of earth,   Has cleansed from guilt of Adams sin   A soul which Jesus died to win.    2. Tis done! the cross upon the brow   Is marked for weal or sorrow now,   To shine with heavenly luster bright,   Or burn in everlasting night.    3.

Teach him to know a Fathers love,   And seek for happiness above,   To Christ his heart and treasures give   And in the Spirit ever live.    5.

1 In token that thou shalt not fear   Christ crucified to own,   We print the cross upon thee here,   And stamp thee His alone.    2 In token that thou shalt not blush   To glory in His Name,   We blazon here upon thy front   His glory and His shame.    3 In token that thou shalt not flinch   Christ's quarrel to maintain,   But 'neath His banner manfully   Firm at thy post remain.    4 In token that thou too shalt tread   The path He travell'd by,   Endure the cross, despise the shame,   And sit thee down on high;    5 Thus outwardly and visibly   We seal thee for His own:   And may the brow that wears His cross   Hereafter share His crown.

1 Once in royal Davids city   stood a lowly cattle shed,   where a mother laid her baby   in a manger for His bed:   Mary was that mother mild,   Jesus Christ her little Child.    2 He came down to earth from heaven   who is God and Lord of all,   and His shelter was a stable,   and His cradle was a stall:   with the poor, and meek, and lowly,   lived on earth our Savior holy.    3 And our eyes at last shall see Him,   through His own redeeming love;   for that Child so dear and gentle   is our Lord in heav'n above,   and He leads His children on   to the place where He is gone.    4 Not in that poor lowly stable,   with the oxen standing by,   we shall see Him, but in heaven,   set at Gods right hand on high;   when like stars His children crowned   all in white shall wait around.

1. Morn of morns, and day of days!   Beauteous were thy newborn rays:   Brighter yet from deathÂ’s dark prison   Christ, the Light of lights, is risen.    2. He commanded, and His Word   Death and the dread chaos heard;   Oh, shall we, more deaf than they,   In the chains of darkness stay?    3. Nature yet in shadow lies;   Let the sons of light arise,   And present the morning rays   With sweet canticles of praise.    4. While the dead world sleeps around,   Let the sacred temples sound   Law, and prophet, and blest psalm   Lit with holy light so calm.    5.

I love to hear the story   which angel voices tell,   how once the King of Glory   came down on earth to dwell.   I am both weak and sinful,   but this I surely know,   the Lord came down to save me,   because He loved me so.    2 Im glad my blessèd Saviour   was once a child like me,   to show how pure and holy   His little ones might be;   and, if I try to follow   His footsteps here below,   He never will forget me,   because He loves me so.    3 To sing His love and mercy   my sweetest songs Ill raise;   and, though I cannot see Him,   I know He hears my praise;   For He has kindly promised   that even I may go   to sing among His angels,   because He loves me so.

1 We are but little children weak,   Nor born in any high estate;   What can we do for Jesus' sake,   Who is so high, and good, and great!    2 When deep within our swelling heart   The thoughts of pride and anger rise,   When bitter words are on our tongues,   And tears of passion in our eyes    3 Then we may stay the angry blow,   Then we may check the hasty word,   Give gentle answers back again,   And fight a battle for our Lord.    4 With smiles of peace and looks of love   Light in our dwellings we may make,   Bid kind good humour brighten there,   And still do all for Jesus' sake.    5 There's not a child so small and weak   But has his little cross to take,   His little work of love and praise   That he may do for Jesus' sake.

Christ, who once among us as a child did dwell,   Is the childrenÂ’s Savior, and He loves us well;   If we keep our promise made Him at the font,   He will be our Shepherd, and we shall not want.    2. There it was they laid us in those tender arms,   Where the lambs are carried safe from all alarms;   If we trust His promise, He will let us rest   In His arms forever, leaning on His breast.    3. Though we may not see Him for a little while,   We shall know He holds us, often feel His smile;   Death will be to slumber, in that sweet embrace,   And we shall awaken to behold His face.    4.

1 How welcome was the call,   And sweet the festal lay,   When Jesus deign'd in Cana's hall   To bless the marriage-day.    2 And happy was the bride,   And glad the bridegroom's heart,   For he who tarried at their side   Bade grief and ill depart.    3 O Lord of life and love,   Come thou again to-day;   And bring a blessing from above   That ne'er shall pass away.    4 O bless, as erst of old,   The bridegroom and the bride;   Bless with the holier stream that flow'd   Forth from thy pierced side.    5 Before thine altar throne   This mercy we implore;   As thou dost knit them, Lord, in one,   So bless them evermore.

1. Christ is gone up; yet ere He passed   From earth, in Heavn to reign,   He formed one holy Church to last   Till He should come again.    2. His twelve Apostles first He made   His ministers of grace;   And they their hands on others laid,   To fill in turn their place.    3. So age by age, and year by year,   His grace was handed on;   And still the holy Church is here,   Although her Lord is gone.    4. Let those find pardon, Lord, from Thee,   Whose love to her is cold:   Bring wanderers in, and let there be   One Shepherd and one fold.    5. And now we haste with thankful feet   To seek our Saviors face;   And in the holy Church to meet,   His chosen dwelling place.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 864

1 O thou who makest souls to shine   with light from lighter worlds above,   and droppest glistening dew divine   on all who seek a SaviourÂ’s love;    2 do thou thy benediction give   on all who teach, on all who learn,   that all thy church may holier live,   and every lamp more brightly burn.    3 Give those who teach pure hearts and wise,   faith, hope, and love, all warmed by prayer;   themselves first training for the skies,   they best will raise their people there.    4 Give those who learn the willing ear,   the spirit meek, the guileless mind;   such gifts will make the lowliest here   far better than a kingdom find.    5 O bless the shepherd; bless the sheep:   that guide and guided both be one,   one in the faithful watch they keep,   until this hurrying life be done.    6 If thus, good Lord, thy grace be given,   in thee to live, in thee to die,   before we upward pass to heaven,   we taste our immortality.

1 The earth, O Lord, is one wide field   of all thy chosen seed;   the crop prepared its fruit to yield;   the labourers are few indeed.    2 We therefore come before thee now   with fasting, and with prayer,   beseeching of thy love that thou   wouldst send more labourers there.    3 Not for our land alone we pray,   though that above the rest;   the realms and islands far away,   O let them all be blest.    4 Endue the bishops of thy flock   with wisdom and with grace,   against false doctrine, like a rock,   to set the heart and face.    5 To all thy priests thy truth reveal,   and make thy judgments clear;   make thou thy deacons full of zeal,   and humble, and sincere:    6 and give their flocks a lowly mind   to hear and to obey;   that each and all may mercy find   at thine appearing-day.

1 How blessed from the bonds of sin   And earthly fetters free,   In singleness of heart and aim   Thy servant, Lord, to be!   The hardest toil to undertake   With joy at thy command,   The meanest office to receive   With meekness at thy hand!    2 With willing heart and longing eyes   To watch before thy gate,   Ready to run the weary race,   To bear the heavy weight;   No voice of thunder to expect,   But follow, calm and still,   For love can easily divine   The One BelovedÂ’s will.    3 Thus may we serve thee, gracious Lord!   Thus ever thine alone,   Our souls and bodies given to thee,   The purchase thou hast won;   Through evil or through good report   Still keeping by thy side.   By life or death, in this poor flesh   Let Christ be magnified!    4 How happily the working days   In this dear service fly!   How rapidly the closing hour,   The time of rest, draws nigh!

For half the earth is Macedon;   These brethren to their brethren call,   And by the Love which loved them all,   And by the whole worlds Life they cry,   "O ye that live, behold we die!"    3 By other sounds the world is won   Than that which wails from Macedon;   The roar of gain is round it rolled,   Or men unto themselves are sold,   And cannot list the alien cry,   "O hear and help us, lest we die."    4 Yet with that cry from Macedon,   The very car of Christ rolls on;   "I come; who would abide My day   In yonder wilds prepare My way;   My voice is crying in their cry;   Help ye the dying, lest ye die."    5 Jesus, for men of Man the Son,   Yea, Thine the cry from Macedon;   O by the kingdom and the power   And glory of Thine advent hour,   Wake heart and will to hear their cry;   Help us to help them, lest we die.

1 We plow the fields and scatter   the good seed on the land,   but it is fed and watered   by Gods almighty hand.

1 To thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise   in hymns of adoration,   to thee bring sacrifice of praise   with shouts of exultation:   bright robes of gold the fields adorn,   the hills with joy are ringing,   the valleys stand so thick with corn   that even they are singing. 2 And now, on this our festal day,   thy bounteous hand confessing,   upon thine altar, Lord, we lay   the first-fruits of thy blessing:   by thee the hungry soul is fed   with gifts of grace supernal;   thou who dost give us earthly bread,   give us the bread eternal. 3 We bear the burden of the day,   and often toil seems dreary;   but labour ends with sunset ray,   and rest comes for the weary:   may we, the angel-reaping o'er,   stand at the last accepted,   Christ's golden sheaves for evermore   to garners bright elected. 4 O blessèd is that land of God,   where saints abide for ever;   where golden fields spread far and broad,   where flows the crystal river:   the strains of all its holy throng   with ours today are blending;   thrice blessèd is that harvest-song   which never hath an ending.

1 The Sower went forth sowing,   the seed in secret slept   through weeks of faith and patience,   till out the green blade crept;   and warmed by golden sunshine,   and fed by silver rain,   at last the fields were whitened   to harvest once again.   O praise the heavenly Sower,   who gave the fruitful seed,   and watched and watered duly,   and ripened for our need.    2 Behold! the heavenly Sower   goes forth with better seed,   the word of sure salvation,   with feet and hands that bleed;   here in his church tis scattered,   our spirits are the soil;   then let an ample fruitage   repay his pain and toil.   Oh, beauteous is the harvest   wherein all goodness thrives,   and this the true thanksgiving,   the first-fruits of our lives.    3 Within a hallowed acre   he sows yet other grain,   when peaceful earth receiveth   the dead he died to gain;   for though the growth be hidden,   we know that they shall rise;   yea even now they ripen   in sunny paradise.   O summer land of harvest,   O fields for ever white   with souls that wear Christs raiment,   with crowns of golden light!    4 One day the heavenly Sower   shall reap where he hath sown,   and come again rejoicing,   and with him bring his own;   and then the fan of judgement   shall winnow from his floor   the chaff into the furnace   that flameth evermore.

1 Day of wrath, O day of mourning!   See fulfilled the prophet's warning:   Heav'n and earth in ashes burning.   Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,   Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth,   All before the throne it bringeth.   O what fear man's bosom rendeth   When from heav'n the Judge descendeth   On whose sentence all dependeth.    2 Death is struck and nature quaking;   All creation is awaking,   To its Judge an answer making.   Lo, the book, exactly worded,   Wherein all hath been recorded;   Thence shall judgment be awarded.   When the Judge His seat attaineth,   And each hidden deed arraigneth,   Nothing unavenged remaineth.    3 What shall I, frail man, be pleading,   Who for me be interceding   When the just are mercy needing?   King of Majesty tremendous,   Who dost free salvation send us,   Fount of pity, then befriend us!   Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution   Grant Thy gift of absolution   Ere the Day of Retribution.    4 Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,   On the cross of suff'ring bought me;   Shall such grace be vainly brought me?   Think, good Jesus, my salvation   Caused Thy wondrous incarnation;   Leave me not to sin's damnation!   Guilty now I pour my moaning,   All my shame with anguish owning:   Hear, O Christ, Thy servant's groaning!    5 Bows my heart in meek submission,   Strewn with ashes of contrition;   Help me in my last condition!   Worthless are my prayers and sighing;   Yet, Good Lord, in grace complying,   Rescue me from fires undying.   Thou the sinful woman savedst;   Thou the dying thief forgavest;   Thus to me true hope vouchsafest!    6 With Thy favored sheep then place me,   Nor among the goats abase me,   But to Thy right hand upraise me.   While the wicked are confounded,   Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,   Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.   To the rest Thou didst prepare me   On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me!

1. The Shepherd now was smitten;   The wolf was ravening near;   The scattered flock he threatened,   But knew not whose they were.    2. In zealous fury seeking   To bind and crucify,   A sudden voice withheld him,   A loud and startling cry:    3. Saul! Saul! why blindly daring   To persecute thy Lord?   Tis Jesus whom thou hatest,   Rebel not at My Word.    4. Then forth in prayer he stretcheth   Those hands prepared to slay;   What wouldst Thou with Thy servant?   My Lord and Master, say.    5. Christs foe becomes His soldier,   The wolf destroys no more,   A gentle lamb he enters   The sheepfold by the door.    6. O voice of God Almighty,   What wonders hath it wrought!   It rends the lofty cedars,   It bends the haughty thought.    7. Jesu, our Shepherd, cease not   Thy flock from harm to free,   And, when Thy sheep are wandering,   O lead them back to Thee.    8. To Father, Son, and Spirit,   All glory, praise and might,   Who called us out of darkness   To His own glorious light.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 6168

1 We sing the glorious conquest   before Damascus gate,   when Saul, the church's spoiler,   came breathing threats and hate;   the ravening wolf rushed forward   full early to the prey;   but lo, the Shepherd met him,   and bound him fast today.    2 O glory most excelling   that smote across his path!   O light that pierced and blinded   the zealot in his wrath,   O voice that spake within him   the calm reproving word,   O love that sought and held him   the bondman of his Lord!    3 O wisdom, ordering all things   in order strong and sweet,   what nobler spoil was ever   cast at the Victor's feet?   What wiser master-builder   e'er wrought at thine employ   than he, till now so furious   your building to destroy?    4 Lord, teach thy church the lesson,   still in her darkest hour   of weakness and of danger   to trust thy hidden power:   thy grace by ways mysterious   the wrath of man can bind,   and in thy boldest foeman   thy chosen saint can find.

1 O Zion, open wide thy gates,   let symbols disappear;   a priest and victim, both in one,   the Truth himself, is here.    2 Aware of hidden deity,   the lowly Virgin brings   her newborn babe, with two young doves,   her humble offerings.    3 The ag√®d Simeon sees at last   his Lord, so long desired,   and Anna welcomes Israel's hope,   with holy rapture fired.    4 But silent knelt the mother blest   of the yet silent Word,   and pondering all things in her heart,   with speechless praise adored.    5 All glory to the Father be,   all glory to the Son,   all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,   while endless ages run.

1 Bishop of the souls of men,   when the foemanÂ’s step is nigh,   when the wolf lays wait by night   for the lambs continually,   watch, O Lord, about us keep,   guard us, Shepherd of the sheep.    2 When the hireling flees away,   caring only for his gold,   and the gate unguarded stands   at the entrance to the fold,   stand, O Lord, thy flock before,   thou the guardian, thou the door.    3 Lord, whose guiding finger ruled   in the casting of the lot,   that thy church might fill the throne   of the lost Iscariot,   in our trouble ever thus   stand, good Master, nigh to us.    4 When the saints their order take   in the New Jerusalem,   and Matthias stands elect,   give us part and lot with him,   where in thine own dwelling-place   we may witness face to face.

1 Praise we the Lord this day,   This day so long foretold,   Whose promise shone with cheering ray   On waiting saints of old.    2 The prophet gave the sign   For faithful folk to read:   A virgin, born of David's line,   Shall bear the promised seed.    3 Ask not how this should be,   But worship and adore   Like her whom God's own majesty   Came down to shadow o'er.    4 She meekly bowed her head   To hear the gracious word:   Hail, Mary, pure and lowly maid,   The favored of the Lord.    5 How blest shall be her name   In all the Church on earth!   Through her that wondrous myst'ry came,   The incarnate Savior's birth.    6 Praise Christ, the Virgin's Son,   Whom earth and heav'n adore,   With Father, Spirit, Three in One   Both now and evermore.

1. New wonders of Thy mighty hand,   Lord, we today admire,   Writ on the firmament above   In glittering orbs of fire.    2. The sun is ruler of the day,   The silver moon of night,   The starry hosts adorn the sky   In ordered ranks of light.    3. But een that glorious sun must set,   And knows his going down,   That silver moon must wax and wane,   The stars their courses own.    4. Still in an ever changing round   The daylight comes and goes;   But Thou art evermore the same,   No change Thy mercy knows.    5. Why waver then our troubled hearts?   Thine is a Fathers care;   And they, eternal life who seek,   Eternal life shall share.    6. All praise, all glory be ascribed   To God the One in Three,   Who bids us cast our care on Him,   To Him for comfort flee.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 4670

1 From out the cloud of amber light,   borne on the whirlwind from the north,   four living creatures winged and bright   before the ProphetÂ’s eyes came forth.    2 The voice of God was in the Four   beneath that awful crystal mist,   and every wondrous form they wore   foreshadowed an Evangelist.    3 The lion-faced, he told abroad   the strength of love, the strength of faith;   he showed the Almighty Son of God,   the Man Divine who won by death.    4 O Lion of the Royal Tribe,   strong Son of God, and strong to save,   all power and honour we ascribe   to thee who only makest brave.    5 For strength to love, for will to speak,   for fiery crowns by martyrs won,   for suffering patience, strong and meek,   we praise thee, Lord, and thee alone.

1 There is one way, and only one,   out of our gloom, and sin, and care,   to that fair land where shines no sun   because the face of God is there.    2 There is one truth, the truth of God,   that Christ came down from heaven to show,   one Life that his redeeming blood   has won for all his saints below.    3 The lore from Philip once concealed,   we know its fullness now in Christ;   in him the Father is revealed,   and all our longing is sufficed.    4 And still unwavering faith holds sure   the words that James wrote sternly down;   except we labour and endure,   we cannot win the heavenly crown.    5 O Way Divine, through gloom and strife,   bring us thy Father's face to see;   O heavenly Truth, O precious Life,   at last, at last, to rest in thee.

But other food, of richer cost,   The immortal spirit needs;   By faith it lives on every word   That from His mouth proceeds.    3. Faith springing from the blood of Christ,   Has flowed oer every land;   And sinners through the vanquished world   Bow down to its command.    4. Its light the joy of Heavn reveals   To hearts made pure within;   And bids them seek by worthy deeds   Eternal crowns to win.    5.

1 Disposer supreme, and Judge of the earth,   who choosest for thine the meek and the poor;   to frail earthen vessels, and things of no worth,   entrusting thy riches which ay shall endure; 2 Those vessels soon fail, though full of thy light,   and at thy decree are broken and gone;   thence brightly appeareth thy truth in its might,   as through the clouds riven the lightnings have shone. 3 Like clouds are they borne to do thy great will,   and swift as the winds about the world go:   the Word with his wisdom their spirits doth fill;   they thunder, they lighten, the waters o'erflow. 4 Their sound goeth forth, 'Christ Jesus the Lord!'   then Satan doth fear, his citadels fall;   as when the dread trumpets went forth at thy word,   and one long blast shattered the Canaanite's wall. 5 O loud be their trump, and stirring their sound,   to rouse us, O Lord, from slumber of sin:   the lights thou hast kindled in darkness around,   O may they awaken our spirits within. 6 All honour and praise, dominion and might,   to God, Three in One, eternally be,   who round us hath shed his own marvellous light,   and called us from darkness his glory to see.

1 Behold us, Lord a little space   From daily tasks set free,   And met within Thy holy place   To rest awhile with Thee.    2 Around us rolls the ceaseless tide   Of business, toil, and care,   And scarcely can we turn aside   For one brief hour of prayer.    3 Yet these are not the only walls   Wherein Thou mayst be sought;   On homeliest work thy blessing falls   In truth and patience wrought.    4 Thine is the loom, the forge, the mart,   The wealth of land and sea;   The worlds of science and of art,   Revealed and ruled by Thee.    5 Then let us prove our heavenly birth   In all we do and know,   And claim the kingdom of the earth   For Thee, and not thy foe.    6 Work shall be prayer, if all be wrought   As thou wouldst have it done;   And prayer, by thee inspired and taught,   Itself with work be one.   AMEN.     Source: The A.M.E. Zion Hymnal: official hymnal of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church # 317

1 The day you gave us, Lord, is ended,   the darkness falls at your request;   to you our morning hymns ascended,   your praise shall sanctify our rest.    2 We thank you that your Church, unsleeping   while earth rolls onward into light,   through all the world her watch is keeping   and never rests by day or night.    3 As over continent and island   each dawn leads to another day,   the voice of prayer is never silent,   nor do the praises die away.    4 So be it, Lord! Your throne shall never,   like earthÂ’s proud empires, pass away;   your kingdom stands and grows forever   until there dawns your glorious day.     Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal # 795

1 This is the day the Lord has made;   he calls the hours his own.   Let heav'n rejoice, let earth be glad   and praise surround the throne.    2 Today he rose and left the dead,   and Satan's empire fell;   today the saints his triumphs spread   and all his wonders tell.    3 Hosanna to th'anointed King,   to David's holy Son!   Help us, O Lord; descend and bring   salvation from the throne.    4 Blessed is Jesus Christ, who came   with messages of grace,   who came in God the Father's name   to save our sinful race.    5 Hosanna in the highest strains   the Church on earth can raise;   the highest heav'ns, in which he reigns,   shall give him nobler praise.

1. Great God, who, hid from mortal sight,   Dost dwell in unapproachèd light,   Before whose throne with veilèd brow,   Thy sinless angels trembling bow.    2. A while in darkness here below   We lie oppressed with sin and woe;   But soon the everlasting day   Shall chase the night of gloom away.    3. The day prepared for us by Thee;   The day reserved for us to see;   A day but faintly imaged here   By brightest sun at noontide clear.    4. Too long, alas! it still delays,   It lingers yet, that day of days;   The flesh, with all its load of sin,   Must perish, ere its joy we win.    5. Then from these earthy bonds set free   The soul shall fly, O God, to Thee;   To see Thee, love Thee, and adore,   Her blissful task for evermore.    6. All bounteous Trinity! prepare   Our souls Thy hidden joy to share,   That our brief daytime, used aright,   May issue in eternal light.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 1760

Of undefiled virgin mother   An Infant all divine was born,   And God Himself became your Brother   Upon this happy Christmas morn.    2 In Him eternal might and power   To human weakness hath inclined;   And this poor Child brings richest dower   Of gifts and graces to mankind.   While here, His majesty disguising,   A servants form the Master wears,   Behold the beams of glory rising,   Een from His poverty and tears.    3 A stable serves Him for a dwelling   And for a bed a manger mean;   Yet oer His head, His advent telling,   A new and wondrous star is seen.   Angels rehearse to men the story,   The joyful story of His birth;   To Him they raise the anthem--"Glory   To God on high and peace on earth!"    4 For thro' this holy incarnation   The primal curse is done away;   And blessed peace oer all creation   Hath shed its pure and gentle ray.

HYMN 507
1. Bounteous Spirit, ever shedding   Life the world to fill!   Swarms the fruitful globe oerspreading,   Shoals their ocean pathway threading,   Own Thy quickening thrill:   Author of each creatures birth,   Life of life beneath the earth,   Everywhere, O Spirit blest,   Thou art motion, Thou art rest.    2. Come, Creator! grace bestowing   All Thy sevenfold dower!   Come, Thy peace and bounty strowing,   Earths renewer! Thine the sowing   Thine the gladdening shower.   Comforter! what joy Thou art   To the blest and faithful heart;   But to mans primeval foe   Uttermost despair and woe.    3. Oer the waters of creation   Moved Thy wings divine;   When the world, to animation   Waking neath Thy visitation,   Teemed with powers benign:   Thou didst man to being call   Didst restore him from his fall;   Pouring, like the latter rain,   Grace to quicken him again.    4. Thine the Gospel voices, crying   As with trumpet sound;   Till the world, in darkness lying,   Rose from deathly sleep, descrying   Heavenly light around.   Man, to reach that prize revealed,   Armed with Thee as with a shield,   Nerved and girt his fight to win,   Quells the prince of death and sin.    5. Lowliest homage now before Thee   Let the ransomed pay;   For Thy wondrous gifts adore Thee,   By Thy holiness implore Thee,   While in love they pray:   Holy! Holy! we repeat,   Kneeling at Thy mercy seat;   There unbosom every woe,   Groanings Thou alone canst know.    6. Fount of grace for every nation,   Refuge of the soul!   Strengthen Thou each new creation,   With the waters of salvation   Make the guilty whole:   Rule on earth the powers that be;   Give us priests inspired of Thee;   Through Thy holy Church increase   Purest unity and peace.    7. Purge and sanctify us wholly   From the leaven of ill;   Save from Satans grasp unholy;   To a living faith and lowly   Mould the upright will;   Till the olden zeal return,   And with mutual love we burn;   Till in peace, no more to roam,   All the flock be gathered home.

To us such plenty of the grace   good Lord grant we thee pray:   That thou maist be our Comforter,   at the last dreadful day.   Of all strife and dissension   O Lord, dissolve the bands,   And make the knots of peace and love   throughout all Christian lands.   Grant us, O Lord, through thee to know   the Father of all might:   That of his deare beloved Sonne   we may attaine the sight.   And that with perfect faith also   we may acknowledge thee   The Spirit of them both alway,   One God in persons three.   Laud and praise be to the Father,   and to the Son equall:   And to the Holy Spirit also,   one God coeternall.   And may we that the only Son   vouchsafe his Spirit to send   To all that do professe his Name,   unto the world's last end.

Lord, give us faith to know thee near,   and grant the grace of holy fear.    3 We have not loved thee as we ought,   nor cared that we are loved by thee;   thy presence we have coldly sought,   and feebly longed thy face to see.   Lord, give a pure and loving heart   to feel and own the love thou art.    4 We have not served thee as we ought;   alas! the duties left undone,   the work with little fervor wrought,   the battles lost or scarcely won!

1. The voice of Gods creation found me   Perplexed midst hope and fear,   For though His sunshine flashed around me,   His storms at times drew near:   And I said   Oh! that I knew where He abideth!   For doubts beset our lot,   And lo! His glorious face He hideth,   And men perceive it not!    2. The Voice of Gods Protection told me   He loveth all He made;   I seemed to feel His arms enfold me,   And yet was half afraid:   And I said   Oh! that I knew where I might find Him!   His eye would guide me right:   He leaveth countless tracks behind Him,   Yet passeth out of sight.    3. The voice of conscience sounded nearer,   It stirred my inmost breast;   But though its tones were firmer, clearer,   Twas not the voice of rest:   And I said   Oh! that I knew if He forgiveth!   My soul is faint within,   Because in grievous fear it liveth   Of wages due to sin.    4. It was the voice of revelation   That met my utmost need;   The wondrous message of salvation   Was joy and peace indeed:   And I said   Oh! how I love the sacred pages   From which such tidings flow,   As monarchs, patriarchs, poets, sages,   Have longed in vain to know!    5. For now is life a lucid story,   And death a rest in Him,   And all is bathed in light and glory   That once was dark or dim:   And I said   O Thou who dost my soul deliver,   And all its hopes uplift;   Give me a tongue praise the Giver,   A heart to prize the gift.

1 Father of mercies, in Thy word,   What endless glory shines!   Forever be Thy name adored   For these celestial lines.    2 Here may the wretched sons of want   Exhaustless riches find:   Riches above what earth can grant   And lasting as the mind.    3 Here the fair tree of knowledge grows,   And yields a free repast;   Sublimer sweets than nature knows   Invites the longing taste.    4 Here the Redeemer's welcome voice   Spreads heavenly peace around;   And life and everlasting joys   Attend the blissful sound.    5 O may these heavenly pages be   My ever dear delight.   And still new beauties may I see,   And still increasing light.    6 Divine Instructor, gracious Lord,   Be Thou forever near:   Teach me to love Thy sacred word   And view my Savior there.

1 Church of the living God,   pillar and ground of truth,   keep the old paths the fathers trod   in thy illumined youth.    2 Lo, in thy bosom lies   the touchstone for the age;   seducing error shrinks and dies   at light from yonder page.    3 Woe to the hands that dare,   by lust of power enticed,   to mingle with the doctrine there   the frauds of Antichrist.    4 Once to the saints was given   all blessèd gospel lore;   there, written down in words from heaven,   thou hast it evermore.    5 Fear not, though doubts abound,   and scoffing tongues deride;   love of Gods word finds surer ground   when to the utmost tried.    6 Toil at thy sacred text;   more fruitful grows the field;   each generation to the next   prepares a richer yield.    7 Gods Spirit in the church,   still lives unspent, untired,   inspiring hearts that fain would search   the truths Himself inspired.    8 Move, Holy Ghost, with might   amongst us as of old;   dispel the falsehood, and unite   in true faith and true fold.

1. Oh how fair that morning broke,   When in Eden man awoke!   Beast and bird and insect bright   Reveled in the gladsome light;   God looked down from Heavn above,   All was life and joy and love.    2. Ah! the doleful change when sin   Darkly, subtly entered in!   War and pestilence and dearth   Mar and sadden Gods fair earth;   Human sorrow fills the air;   Death is reigning everywhere.    3. Yet rejoice; for God on high   Hath not left His world to die!   Gods dear Son, with dying breath,   Broke the power of sin and death;   Christ the Tempter overthrew,   Christ is making all things new.    4.

With salvation's walls surrounded,   thou may'st smile at all thy foes.    2 See, the streams of living waters,   springing from eternal love,   well supply thy sons and daughters   and all fear of want remove.   Who can faint while such a river   ever flows their thirst to assuage?   Grace, which like the Lord, the Giver,   never fails from age to age.    3 'Round each habitation hov'ring,   see the cloud and fire appear   for a glory and a cov'ring,   showing that the Lord is near.

1. And now this holy day   Is drawing to its end,   Once more, to Thee, O Lord,   Our thanks and prayers we send.    2. We thank Thee for this rest   From earthly care and strife;   We thank Thee for this help   To higher, holier life.    3. We thank Thee for Thy house;   It is Thy palace-gate   Where Thou, upon Thy throne   Of mercy, still dost wait.    4. We thank Thee for Thy Word,   Thy Gospels joyful sound;   Oh, may its holy fruits   Within our hearts abound!    5. Yet, ere we go to rest,   Father, to Thee we pray,   Forgive the sins that stain   Een this Thy holy day.    6. Through Jesus let the past   Be blotted from Thy sight,   And let us all now sleep   At peace with Thee this night.    7. To God the Father, Son,   And Spirit glory be,   From all in earth and Heavn,   Through all eternity.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 199

1 Up in heaven, up in heaven,   In the bright place far away,   He whom bad men crucified   Sitteth at His Father's side,   Till the Judgment Day.    2 And He loves His little children,   And He pleads for children there,   Asking the great God of heaven   That their sins may be forgiven,   And He hears their prayers.    3 Nevermore a helpless Baby,   Born in poverty and pain;   But with awful glory crowned,   With His Angels standing round,   He shall come again.    4 Then the wicked souls shall tremble,   And the good souls shall rejoice;   Parents, children, every one,   Then shall stand before His Throne,   And shall hear His voice.    5 And all faithful, holy Christians,   Who their Master's work have done,   Shall appear at His right hand,   And inherit the fair land   That His love has won.   Amen.     Source: Voices of Praise: for school and church and home # 39

1. O my God, I fear Thee! Thou art very high,   Yet to us, Thy children, Thou art always nigh,   Far removed from mortal sight,   Dwelling in eternal light.    2. O my God, I fear Thee! Yet I come in prayer,   For my Savior tells me I need not despair;   Tells me of a FatherÂ’s love,   And a home prepared above.    3. Never earthly father Loveth like to Thee;   Thou dost guide and pardon Guilty ones like me;   Sending down Thy holy Son   That all sinners might be won.    4. O my God, I fear Thee! Holy, just, and true;   But, my heavenly Father, I will love Thee, too;   Guide me till this life be past,   Take me to Thyself at last.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 5170

1 Lamb of God, I look to Thee:   Thou shalt my example be;   Thou art gentle, meek, and mild;   thou wast once a little child.    2 Fain I would be as Thou art;   Give me Thy obedient heart;   Thou art pitiful and kind,   Let me have Thy loving mind.    3 Let me, above all, fulfill   God my heavenly Father's will,   Never His good Spirit grieve,   Only to His glory live.    4 Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,   In Thy gracious hands I am;   Make me, Savior, what Thou art,   Live Thyself within my heart.    5 I shall then show forth Thy praise,   Serve Thee all my happy days;   Then the world shall always see   Christ the holy Child in me.

1 Do no sinful action,   speak no angry word;   ye belong to Jesus,   children of the Lord.    2 Christ is kind and gentle,   Christ is pure and true;   and his little children   must be holy too.    3 Theres a wicked spirit   watching round you still,   and he tries to tempt you   to all harm and ill.    4 But ye must not hear him,   though tis hard for you   to resist the evil,   and the good to do.    5 For ye promised truly,   in your infant days,   to renounce him wholly,   and forsake his ways.    6 Ye are new-born Christians   ye must learn to fight   with the bad within you,   and to do the right.    7 Christ is your own Master,   he is good and true,   and his little children   must be holy too.

1 O Christ, Redeemer of our race,   thou brightness of the Fathers face,   of him, and with him ever one,   ere times and seasons had begun;    2 thou art that very Light of light,   unfailing hope in sins dark night,   hear thou the prayers thy people pray,   The wide world oer, this blessèd day.    3 Remember, Lord of life and grace,   how once, to save a ruined race,   thou didst our very flesh assume   in Marys undefilèd womb.    4 Today, as year by year its light   sheds oer the world a radiance bright,   one precious truth is echoed on,   tis thou hast saved us, thou alone.    5 Thou from the Fathers throne didst come   to call his banished children home;   and heavn, and earth, and sea, and shore   his love who sent thee here adore.    6 And gladsome too are we today,   whose guilt thy blood has washed away;   redeemed the new-made song we sing;   it is the birthday of our King.    7 O Lord, the virgin-born, to thee   eternal praise and glory be,   whom with the Father we adore   and Holy Ghost forevermore.

1 Every morn the golden sun   Rises warm and bright;   But the evening cometh on,   And the cold, dark night:   Theres a bright land far away   Where tis never ending day.    2 Every sprint the sweet young flowrs   Open fresh and gay,   Till the chilly autumn hours   Wither them away!   Theres a land we have not seen,   Where the trees are always green.    3 Little birds sing songs of praise   All the summer long.   But in colder, shorter days   They forget their song:   Theres a place where angels sing   Ceaseless praises to their King.    4 Christ our Lord is ever near   Those who follow Him!   But we cannot see Him here,   For our eyes are dim:   There is a most happy place,   Where well always see His face.    5 Who shall go to that fair land?   All who love the right:   Holy children there shall stand,   In their robes of white;   In that heavn so bright and blest,   Is our everlasting rest.

1 Sing to the Lord the childrens hymn,   His gentle love declare,   Who bends amid the seraphim   To hear the childrens prayer.    2 He at a mothers breast was fed,   Though Gods own Son was he;   He learnt the first small words he said   At a meek mothers knee. A-men.    3 He held us to his mighty breast,   The children of the earth;   He lifted up his hands and blessed   The babes of human birth.    4 Lo! from the stars his face will turn   On us with glances mild;   The angels of His presence yearn   To bless the little child.    5 Keep us, O Jesus Lord, for thee,   That so by thy dear grace   We, children of the font, may see   Our heavenly Fathers face.   Amen.     Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America # 335

1 Lord, I would own thy tender care,   and all thy love to me;   the food I eat, the clothes I wear,   are all bestowed by thee.    2 'Tis thou preservest me from death   and dangers every hour;   I cannot draw another breath   unless thou give me power.    3 Kind angels guard me every night,   as round my bed they stay;   nor am I absent from thy sight   in darkness or by day.    4 My health and friends and parents dear   to me by God are given;   I have not any blessing here   but what is sent from heaven.    5 Such goodness, Lord, and constant care   I never can repay;   but may it be my daily prayer,   to love thee and obey.

1 Hushed was the evening hymn,   the temple courts were dark;   the lamp was burning dim   before the sacred ark;   when suddenly a Voice Divine   rang through the silence of the shrine.    2 The old man, meek and mild,   the priest of Israel, slept;   his watch the Temple child,   the little Levite, kept;   and what from Elis sense was sealed   the Lord to Hannahs son revealed.    3 Oh! give me Samuels ear,   the open ear, O Lord,   alive and quick to hear   each whisper of thy word;   like him to answer at yhy call,   and to obey thee first of all.    4 Oh! give me Samuels heart,   a lowly heart, that waits   where in thy house thou art,   or watches at thy gates;   ny day and night, a heart that still   moves at the breathing of thy will.    5 Oh! give me Samuels mind,   a sweet unmurmuring faith,   obedient and resigned   to thee in life and death;   that I may read with child-like eyes   truths that are hidden from the wise.

1. Within the churchyard, side by side,   Are many long low graves;   And some have stones set over them,   On some the green grass waves.    2. Full many a little Christian child,   Woman, and man, lies there;   And we pass near them every time   When we go in to prayer.    3. They cannot hear our footsteps come,   They do not see us pass;   They cannot feel the warm bright sun   That shines upon the grass.    4. They do not hear when the great bell   Is ringing overhead;   They cannot rise and come to church   With us, for they are dead.    5. But we believe a day shall come   When all the dead will rise,   When they who sleep down in the grass,   Will ope again their eyes.    6. For Christ our Lord was buried once,   He died and rose again,   He conquered death, He left the grave;   And so will Christian men.    7. So when the friends we love the best   Lie in their churchyard bed,   We must not cry too bitterly   Over the happy dead;    8. Because, for our dear Saviors sake,   Our sins are all forgivn;   And Christians only fall asleep   To wake again in Heavn.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 7152

Keep the spell of home affection   Still alive in every heart;   May its power, with mild direction,   Draw our love from self apart,   Till Thy children   Feel that Thou their Father art.    4.

Bless Thou all our days of leisure;   Help us selfish lures to flee;   Sanctify our every pleasure;   Pure and blameless may it be;   May our gladness   Draw us evermore to Thee.    3.

1 O Father, all-creating,   Whose wisdom, love, and pow'r   First bound two lives together   In Eden's primal hour,   To these who come before you,   Your earliest gifts renew:   A home by you made happy,   A love by you kept true.    2 O Savior, guest in Cana   Of old in Galilee,   May these who ask your blessing   Your loving presence see.   Their store of earthly gladness   Transform to heav'nly wine,   And teach them, in the testing,   To know your gift divine.    3 O Spirit of the Father,   Breathe on them from above,   So mighty in your pureness,   So tender in your love;   That, guarded by your presence,   From sin and strife kept free,   Their hearts may seek your guidance,   And love you faithfully.    4 Unless you build it, Father,   The house is built in vain;   Unless you bless it, Savior,   The joy will turn to pain;   But none can break the union   Of hearts in you made one;   The love your Spirit blesses   Is endless love begun.

A manger, stall, and swaddling clothes,   a child and mother poor!    5 Art thou the Christ? The Son?   The FatherÂ’s image bright?   And see we him whose arm upholds   earth and the starry height?    6 Yea, faith can pierce the cloud   which veils thy glory now;   we hail Thee God, before whose throne   the angels prostrate bow.    7 Our sinful pride to cure   with that pure love of thine,   O be thou born within our hearts,   most holy Child divine.

Holy Jesus, Eye most loving,   On each young disciple bent;   Voice that, seeming earthly, summoned   Samuel to the awful tent;   Hand that cast Elijahs mantle;   Thine be all Thy grace hath lent.    3. As to Thine own seventy scholars   Thou of old Thine arm didst reach,   Under Thy majestic shadow   Guiding them to do and teach,   Till their hour of solemn unction;   So be with us all and each.    4. God and Father of all spirits,   Whose dread call young Joshua knew,   Forty days in darkness waiting   With Thy servant good and true,   Thence to wage Thy war descending,   Own us, Lord, Thy champions, too.    5. One Thy light, the temple filling,   Holy, holy, holy Three;   Meanest men and brightest angels   Wait alike the word from Thee;   Highest musings, lowliest worship,   Must their preparation be.    6. Now Thou speakesthear we trembling   From the glory comes a voice.   Who accepts thAlmightys mission?   Who will make Christs work his choice?   Who for Us proclaim to sinners,   Turn, believe, endure, rejoice?    7. Here are we, Redeemer, send us!   But because Thy work is fire,   And our lips, unclean and earthly,   Breathe no breath of high desire;   Send Thy seraph from the altar   Veiled, but in his bright attire.    8. Cause him, Lord, to fly full swiftly   With the mystic coal in hand,   Sin consuming, soul transforming,   (Faith and love will understand);   Touch our lips, Thou awful Mercy   With Thine own keen healing brand.    9. Thou didst come that fire to kindle;   Fain would we Thy torches prove,   Far and wide Thy beacons lighting   With thundying spark of love:   Only feed our flame, we pray Thee,   With Thy breathings from above.    10. Now to God, the souls Creator,   To His Word and wisdom sure,   To His all enlightening Spirit,   Patron of the frail and poor,   Three in One, be praise and glory,   Here and while the heavns endure.

1. Sons of labor, dear to Jesus,   To your homes and work again;   Go with brave hearts back to duty,   Face the peril, bear the pain.   Be your dwellings neer so lowly,   Yet remember, by your bed,   That the Son of God most holy   Had not where to lay His head.    2. Sons of labor, think of Jesus   As you rest your homes within,   Think of that sweet babe of Mary   In the stable of the inn.   Think how in the sacred story   Jesus took a humble grade,   And the Lord of life and glory   Worked with Joseph at His trade.    3. Sons of labor, pray to Jesus;   Oh, how Jesus prayed for you!   In the moonlight, on the mountain,   Where the shimmering olives grew.   When you rise up at the dawning,   Ere in toil you wend your way,   Pray, as He prayed, in the morning,   Long before the break of day.    4. Sons of labor, be like Jesus,   Undefilèd, chaste, and pure;   And, though Satan tempt you sorely,   By His grace you shall endure.   Husband, father, son and brother,   Be ye gentle, just and true   Be ye kind to one another,   As the Lord is kind to you.    5. Sons of labor, seek for Jesus,   Where He tells you ye shall find,   In the children, mid the mourners,   In the sick, poor, lame and blind   Search the Scriptures, He entreats you,   For of Me they testify;   Love His altar, where He meets you,   Saying, Fear notIt is I.    6. Sons of labor, go to Jesus,   In your sorrow, shame and loss;   He is nearest, you are dearest,   When you bravely bear His cross.   Go to Him, who died to save you,   And is still the sinners friend;   And the great love, which forgave you,   Will forgive you to the end.    7. Sons of labor, live for Jesus,   Be your work your worship, too;   In His name, and to His glory,   Do whateer you find to do;   Till this night of sin and sorrow   Be for ever overpast;   And we see the golden morrow,   Home with Jesus, home at last!

1 Unchanging God, hear from eternal heaven:   We plead Thy gifts of grace, forever given,   Thy call, without repentance, calling still,   The sure election of Thy sov'reign will.    2 Out of our faith in Thee, who canst not lie,   Out of our hearts desire, goes up the cry,   From hopes sweet vision of the thing to be,   From love to those who still are loved by Thee.    3 Bring Thy beloved back, Thine Israel,   Thine own elect who from Thy favor fell,   But not from Thine election! O forgive,   Speak but the word, and, lo! the dead shall live.    4 Father of mercies! these the long astray,   These in soul-blindness now the faraway,   These are not aliens, but Thy sons of yore,   O, by Thy Father-hood, restore, restore!    5 Breathe on Thy Church, that it may greet the day;   Stir up her will to toil, and teach, and pray,   Till Zion-ward again salvation come,   And all her out-cast children are at home.    6 Triune Jehovah, Thine the grace and power,   Thine all the work, its past, its future hour;   O Thou, who failest not, Thy gifts fulfill,   And crown the calling of Thy changeless will.

1. Thou, the Christ forever one,   Marys child and Israels God,   Daniels prince and Davids son,   Jacobs star and Jesses rod,   Thou of whom of the prophets spake,   Thou in whom their words came true,   Hear the pleading prayer we make,   Hear the Gentile for the Jew!    2. Knowing what the Spirit saith,   Sure of Thee, our Christ divine,   Lo, we stand, by right of faith,   Heirs of Abrahams chartered line;   Can we then his sons forget,   Branches severed from their tree,   Exiles from their homes, and yet   Kinsmen, Lord, in flesh to Thee?    3. Though the blood betrayed and spilt,   On the race entailed a doom,   Let its virtue cleanse the guilt,   Melt the hardness, chase the gloom;   Lift the veil from off their heart,   Make them Israelites indeed,   Meet once more for lot and part   With Thy households genuine seed.    4. Thou that didst Thy dews outpour,   Crowning alien grafts with fruit,   Soon the native growths restore,   Making glad the parent root:   Ah! but let not pride ensnare   Souls that need to mourn their sin;   Still the boughs adopted spare,   And the outcastsgraft them in!    5. Speed the day of union sweet   When with us in faith allied,   Israels heart shall turn to greet   Thee, whom Israel crucified;   Thee, in all Thy truth and grace,   Owned at last as Salems king,   While her children find their place,   Gathered safe beneath Thy wing.

1 O Lord, be with us when we sail   Upon the lonely deep,   Our Guard when on the silent deck   The midnight watch we keep.    2 We need not fear, though all around   'Mid rising winds we hear   The multitude of waters surge,   For Thou, O God, art near.    3 The calm, the breeze, the gale, the storm   That pass from land to land,   All, all are Thine, are held within   The hollow of Thy hand.    4 Across this troubled tide of life   Our Pilot Thou abide   Until we reach that better land,   Beyond both time and tide.    5 To Thee the Father, Thee the Son,   Whom earth and sky adore,   And Spirit, moving on the deep,   Be praise for evermore.

1. O God, who metest in Thine hand   The waters of the mighty sea,   And barrest ocean with the sand   By Thy perpetual decree:    2. What time the floods lift up their voice   And break in anger on the shore,   When deep to deep calls with the noise   Of waterspouts and billows roar;    3. When they who to the sea go down,   And in the waters ply their toil,   Are lifted on the surges crown,   And plunged where seething eddies boil;    4. Rule then, O Lord, the oceans wrath,   And bind the tempest with Thy will;   Tread, as of old, the waters path   And speak Thy bidding, Peace, be still.    5.

1 At thy feet, O Christ, we lay   thine own gift of this new day;   doubt of what it holds in store   makes us crave thine aid the more;   lest it prove a time of loss,   mark it, Saviour, with thy cross.    2 If it flow on calm and bright,   be thyself our chief delight:   if it bring unknown distress,   good is all that thou canst bless;   only, while its hours begin,   pray we, keep them clear of sin.    3 We in part our weakness know,   and in part discern our foe;   well for us, before thine eyes   all our danger open lies;   turn not from us, while we plead   thy compassions and our need.    4 Fain would we thy word embrace,   live each moment on thy grace,   all our selves to thee consign,   fold up all our wills in thine,   think and speak and do and be   simply that which pleases thee.    5 Hear us, Lord, and that right soon;   hear, and grant the choicest boon   that thy love can eÂ’er impart,   loyal singleness of heart:   do shall this and all our days,   Christ our God, show forth thy praise.

1 Thou hidden Love of God, whose height,   whose depth unfathomed, no man knows,   I see from far Thy beauteous light,   and inly sigh for Thy repose;   my heart is pained, nor can it be   at rest till it finds rest in Thee.    2 'Tis mercy all that Thou hast brought   my mind to seek its peace in Thee;   yet while I seek, but find Thee not,   no peace my wand'ring soul shall see.   O when shall all my wand'rings end,   and all my steps to Thee-ward tend?    3 Is there a thing beneath the sun   that strives with Thee my heart to share?   Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,   the Lord of every motion there;   then shall my heart from earth be free,   when it has found repose in Thee.    4 O hide this self from me, that I   no more, but Christ in me, may live;   my vile affections crucify,   nor let one darling lust survive;   in all things nothing may I see,   nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.    5 O Love, Thy sov'reign aid impart   to save me from low-thoughted care;   chase this self-will from all my heart,   from all its hidden mazes there;   make me Thy duteous child, that I   may ceaseless "Abba, Father," cry.    6 Each moment draw from earth away   my heart, that lowly waits Thy call;   speak to my inmost soul, and say   "I am Thy Love, Thy God, Thy all."

1 Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,   whereon the Savior of the world was born;   rise to adore the mystery of love,   which hosts of angels chanted from above;   with them the joyful tidings were begun   of God incarnate and the virgin's Son.    2 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,   who heard th'angelic herald's voice: "Behold,   I bring good tidings of a Savior's birth   to you and all the nations of the earth;   this day hath God fulfilled His promised word;   this day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord."    3 He spake, and straightway the celestial choir   in hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire;   the praises of redeeming love they sang,   and heav'n's whole orb with alleluias rang;   God's highest glory was their anthem still,   peace on the earth, and unto men good will.    4 To Bethl'hem straight the happy shepherds ran,   to see the wonder God had wrought for man;   and found, with Joseph and the blessed maid,   her Son, the Savior, in a manger laid;   amazed, the wondrous story they proclaim,   the earliest heralds of the Savior's name.    5 Oh, may we keep and ponder in our mind   God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind!   Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,   from His poor manger to His bitter cross.   Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,   till our imperfect state God doth replace.    6 Then may we hope, th'angelic hosts among,   to sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song;   He that was born upon this joyful day   around us all His glory shall display;   saved by His love, incessant we shall sing   eternal praise to heav'n's almighty King.

With these to part,   and lay up treasure in the heart    who now with crown of light doth shine   among the apostolic line.    5 Come, Saviour, as in days of old;   pass where the world has strongest hold,   and faithless care and selfish greed   are thorns that choke the holy seed.    6 Who keep thy gifts, O bid them claim   the stewards, not the owners name;   who yield all up for thy dear sake,   let them of Matthews wealth partake.

1 Life and strength of all thy servants,   brightness of the Fathers light;   men with angels, earth with heaven,   in thy praise their songs unite.    2 Thousand thousand warrior princes   in thine angel army stand;   flames the victor cross before them,   grasped in Michaels dauntless hand.    3 Hurling back from heaven the rebels   with the lifting of his sword,   in the might of God he tramples   on the dragons head abhorred.    4 Lord of Angels, Christ, we pray thee,   bid them aid us in our strife,   chase afar the hosts of evil,   till we reach the land of life.    5 God the Father, God Immortal,   God the Son, for us who died,   God the Comforter, the Spirit,   evermore be glorified!

1. Father, before Thy throne of light   The guardian angels bend,   And ever in Thy presence bright   Their psalms adoring blend;   And casting down each golden crown,   Beside the crystal sea,   With voice and lyre, in happy quire,   Hymn glory, Lord, to Thee.    2. And as the rainbow luster falls   Athwart their glowing wings,   While seraph unto seraph calls,   And each Thy goodness sings;   So may we feel, as low we kneel   To pray Thee for Thy grace,   That Thou art here for all who fear   The brightness of Thy face.    3. Here, where the angels see us come   To worship day by day,   Teach us to seek our heavnly home,   And love Thee een as they;   Teach us to raise our notes of praise,   With them Thy love to own,   That childhoods flower and manhoods power   Be Thine, and Thine alone.

1. Bride of Christ, whose glorious warfare   Here on earth hath never rest;   Lift thy voice, and tell the triumphs   Of the holy and the blest;   Joyous be the day we hallow,   Feast of all the saints on high,   Earth and Heavn together blending   In one solemn harmony.    2. First the blessèd virgin mother,   Reunited to her Son,   Leads the host of ransomed people,   Who unfading crowns have won;   John, the herald, Christs forerunner,   More than prophet, leads his throng,   Seer and patriarch responsive   Unto psalmist in their song.    3. Lo, the twelve, majestic princes,   In the court of Jesus sit,   Calmly watching, while the conflict   Rages far beneath their feet;   Lo, the martyrs, robed in crimson,   Sign of life blood freely spent,   Finding life, because they lost it,   Dwell in undisturbed content.    4. All the saintly host who witnessed   Good confessions for His sake   Priest and deacon, world renouncing,   Of their Masters joy partake;   Virgins to the Lamb devoted,   Following with steadfast love,   Bring their lilies and their roses   To the marriage feast above.    5. All, their happy lot fulfilling,   God omnipotent proclaim;   Holy, holy, holy, crying,   Glory to His holy name!

1. Who the multitudes can number   In the mansions of the blest,   He can weigh the joys eternal   By those ransomed ones possessed;   Exiled now on earth no longer,   They have gained the home of rest.    2. Happily at last delivered   From the mournful vale of tears,   Sweet is now their recollection   Of the sad and troubled years;   While fulfilled in all perfection   Gods eternal plan appears.    3. They behold their tempter fallen,   Bound in everlasting chain;   Praising Christ their gracious Savior,   All unite in joyful strain,   Christ the great reward and portion   Which adoring spirits gain.    4. Now in shadow and in figure,   Mirrored in imperfect light;   Then, as we are known, our knowledge   Shall be clear, unveiled, and bright;   For on Gods unclouded glory   We shall gaze with cleansèd sight.    5. Then the Trinity of Persons   We shall face to face behold,   And the unity of substance   Shall its mystery unfold;   As the wondrous triune Godhead   We adore in bliss untold.    6. Courage, man, be strong, be faithful,   Whatsoeer thy burden be,   For unbounded are the glories   Which thy sorrows work for thee;   Soon the light of light forever   Shall thine eyes with rapture see.    7.

HYMN 62
1 While shepherds watched their flocks by night,   all seated on the ground,   an angel of the Lord came down,   and glory shone around.    2 "Fear not," said he for mighty dread   had seized their troubled mind   "glad tidings of great joy I bring   to you and all mankind.    3 "To you, in David's town, this day   is born of David's line   a Savior, who is Christ the Lord;   and this shall be the sign:    4 "The heavenly babe you there shall find   to human view displayed,   all simply wrapped in swaddling clothes   and in a manger laid."    5 Thus spoke the angel. Suddenly   appeared a shining throng   of angels praising God, who thus   addressed their joyful song:    6 "All glory be to God on high,   and to the earth be peace;   to those on whom his favor rests   goodwill shall never cease."

1. In royal robes of splendor,   Before the great Kings feet,   The princes of His kingdom,   The crowned apostles, meet;   To Him their songs adoring   With heart and tongue they bring,   Pure hearts and mighty voices   Een as the angels sing.    2. This Order sheds its luster   Oer all the human race;   A court of righteous judgment,   The rock of Gospel grace;   Rock of His Church, for ages   Elected and foreknown;   Whose glorious master builder   Is head and cornerstone.    3. These are the Nazareans,   Famed heralds to the world,   Who, preaching Christ, His banner   Of victory unfurled;   Day unto day shows knowledge;   Night utters speech to night;   So these to earths four corners   Their wondrous tale recite.    4. Christs burden light they proffer,   His easy yoke proclaim;   The seed of life they scatter,   That all may own His name.   The earth brought forth and budded,   Whereer their ploughshare ran,   And fruits of increase followed   The faith of God made man.    5. These are the sure foundation   On which the Temple stands;   The living stones compacting   That house not made with hands;   The gates by which man enters   Jerusalem the new;   The bond which knits together   The Gentile and the Jew.    6. Let error flee before them,   Let truth extend her way;   Let dread of final judgment   To faith and love give way;   That, loosed from our offenses,   We then may numbered be   Among Thy saints in glory   Around the throne with Thee.

Cry that opened Heavn is shown thee:   Cry that JESUS waits to own thee:   Cry it with thy latest breath!

Of sins that as a cloud have hid Thy face,   Of Thy care slighted, and thy grievèd grace,   Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:   In Love, that puts sins envious veil aside,   Rending the veil of flesh which for me died,   Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.    5. For sin I mourn, the sin that gave Thee pain;   Thine was the burden, mine alone the stain;   Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:   Christ is my joy; and out of all distress   He doth deliver with His righteousness:   Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.

1 Lord, through this holy week of our salvation,   which thou hast won for us who went astray,   in all the conflict of thy sore temptation   we would continue with thee day by day.    2 We would not leave thee, though our weak endurance   make us unworthy here to take our part;   yet give us strength to trust the sweet assurance   that thou, O Lord, art greater than our heart.    3 Thou didst forgive thine own who slept for sorrow,   thou didst have pity: O have pity now,   and let us watch through each sad eve and morrow   with thee, in holy prayer and solemn vow.    4 Along that sacred way where thou art leading,   which thou didst take to save our souls from loss,   let us go also, till we see yhee pleading   in all-prevailing prayer upon thy cross.    5 Until thou see thy bitter travails ending,   the world redeemed, the will of God complete,   and, to thy Fathers hands thy soul commending,   thou lay the work he gave thee at his feet.

1. O word of pity, for our pardon pleading,   Breathed in the hour of loneliness and pain;   O voice, which through the ages interceding,   Calls us to fellowship with God again.    2. O word of comfort, through the silence stealing,   As the dread act of sacrifice began;   O infinite compassion, still revealing   The infinite forgiveness won for man.    3. O word of hope to raise us nearer Heaven,   When courage fails us and when faith is dim;   The souls for whom Christ prays to Christ are given,   To find their pardon and their joy in Him.    4. O Intercessor, who art ever living   To plead for dying souls that they may live,   Teach us to know our sin which needs forgiving,   Teach us to know the love which can forgive.

1. O perfect God, Thy love   As perfect Man did share   Here upon earth each form of ill   Thy fellow men must bear.    2. Now from the tree of scorn   We hear Thy voice again;   Thou who didst take our mortal flesh   Hast felt our mortal pain.    3. Thy body suffers thirst,   Parched are Thy lips and dry:   How poor the offering man can bring   Thy thirst to satisfy!    4. O Savior, by Thy thirst   Borne on the cross of shame,   Grant us in all our sufferings leave   To glorify Thy name.    5. That through each pain and grief   Our souls may onward move   To gain more likeness to Thy life,   More knowledge of Thy love.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 5280

Glory to God! The morn appointed breaks,   And earth awakes from all the woeful past;   For, with the morn, the Lord of Life awakes,   And sin and death into the grave are cast.   Glory to God! The cross, with all its shame,   Now sheds its glory o'er a ransomed world;   For He who bore the burden of our blame,   With pierced hands the foe to hell hath hurled.   Glory to God! Sing ransomed souls again,   And let your songs our glorious Victor laud,   Who by His might hath snapped the tyrant's chain,   And set us free to rise with Him to God.    84   Darkness and night, farewell! the morn is here;   Welcome! the light that ushers in the day;   Visions of joy before our sight appear,   And like the clouds, our sorrows melt away.   Great Son of God, Immortal and renowned!   Brighter than morn the glory on Thy brow;   Crowns must be won, and Thou art nobly crowned,   For death is dead, and sin is vanquished now.

Of the blessèd Trinity!    4 In this Name the heart rejoices,   Pouring forth its secret prayer:   In this Name we lift our voices,   And our common faith declare;   Offering humble supplication,   Thanks, and praise, and veneration   To the blessèd Trinity!   To the blessèd Trinity!    5 Glory be to God the Father,   Glory be to God the Son,   Glory be to God the Spirit,   Great Jehovah, Three in One.

Almighty Father, unoriginate,   Whom no man hath seen ever, nor can see;   Who reignest blest and only potentate,   Light unapproachable encircling Thee:   Almighty Father, hallowed be Thy name;   Who ever art, unchangeably the same.    2. Thou lovest us, else had we never been:   Before we were, in ages long ago,   Thy love had us and all our wants foreseen,   Creating us that we Thy love might know,   Yea, Father, Thou, in whom we live and move,   Hast loved us with an everlasting love.    3. Thou madest man immortal at the first,   An image of Thine own eternity;   And when he fell from life, through sin accursed,   And lost his right to the life giving tree,   Thy love, unconquered would to him restore   His life ennobled and forevermore.    4. Such was Thy love, Thou didst not even spare   Thy Best-beloved, but gavst Him for us all;   To live that human life beyond compare,   And dying, by His death retrieve our fall.   In Him Thy love unbounded we behold,   For, giving Him, Thou canst not aught withhold.    5. Thou knowest what we are, how frail and blind,   Thou still rememberest that we are but dust:   Like as a father pitieth, Thou art kind,   Thy justice kindness, and Thy kindness just.

I. ( 1- 11).   Lift up thyself, my soul,   Above this world's control!   Spend and be spent in holy hymns of praise:   Be armed with pure desire,   Burn with celestial fire:   Unto the King of gods our voice we raise:   To Him a crown we weave, and bring   A sacrifice of words, a bloodless offering.   II. ( 11- 22).    20   Thee on the troubled deep,   Thee o'er the islands steep,   Thee through the mighty continents of land,   Thee in the city's throng,   Or mountain tops along,   Or when in celebrated plains I stand,   Thee, Thee, O blessed One, I sing,   Thee, Thee, O Father of the world, Eternal King!   III. ( 23- 36).   Thy praise I hymn by night,   Thy praise at morning light,   Thy praise by day, Thy praise at eventide.   This know the hoary stars,   And moon with silver bars,   And chiefly he that doth on high preside   O'er all the host of heaven, the sun,   Who measuring time for holy souls his course doth run.   IV. ( 37- 50).    21   Fain to thy folds I sped,   And to Thy bosom fled,   Winging my steps from Matter's wide-spread rule:   Now on famed mountain peak,   Thy face alone to seek;   Now on the plain I hailed thy vestibule.   A suppliant thus to many a shrine   Of sacred rites I came, and mysteries divine.   V. ( 51- 67).   And now to southern land,   And Libya's desert strand   I roamed, where neither godless spirit reigns,   Nor teeming cities' strife   Calls men to busy life;   That so my soul, from woeful toils and pains   And passions' war and groans set free,   And all the ills of fate, might harmonize with Thee.   VI. ( 68- 75).    22   And might, in blest relief,   Unshackled now from grief,   With lips and tongue all cleansed, and hallowed mind,   Repay the hymn to Thee,   The hymn full due from me.   Be Earth and Ether holily combined   And Air and Sea with one accord   Be still, and join in adoration to the Lord!   VII. ( 76- 85).   Swift breath of winds, be still,   And whirling pool and rill,   And floods that are at rivers' mouths forth hurled;   And streams from fountain-heads   That rush down rocky beds:   And hushed be ye, deep hollows of the world;   While breath in holy hymns is spent,   And sacrifice of praise in upward strains is sent.   VIII. ( 86- 94).    23   Down sink the serpent's trail!   Nor let their craft prevail!   Down sink the wingèd dragon underground;   Who loves to cloud the soul,   The god who doth control   This lower world, and idol-worship found,   And urgeth on the dogs of hell   Against God's praying people, His true Israel!   IX. ( 95- 107).   O blessèd Father, Friend,   My soul do Thou defend.   From soul-devouring dogs; defend my prayer,   Defend my deeds, my life,   From their destructive strife   And charge Thy holy angels, that they bear   To Thee this offering of my mind:   For hymns they carry that with Thee acceptance find.   X. ( 108- 117).    24   Now am I borne along   To lists of sacred song:   Now holy words in streams spontaneous flow:   A voice within me rings,   And toucheth my heart-strings:   But unto me, O Father, mercy show;   Forgive, O Blessèd, if I stray,   In theme divine, and miss the rightful ordered way.   XI. ( 118- 125).   What eye can steadfast gaze,   When Thy dread beacons blaze?   What eye so wise, so strong, of mortal man,   That it unclosed may bear   Thy vivid lightning's glare?   E'en of the mighty ones on high none can,   However strong, however bold,   The glorious brightness of Thy Majesty behold.   XII. ( 126- 137).    25   Now aims the mind too far,   And finds repelling bar,   Nor can it penetrate by utmost strain   The depths so dazzling bright,   Where Thou dost dwell in light:   So, falling back from efforts feebly vain,   It courts within its proper scope   An object known whereon to fix the eye of hope;   XIII. ( 138- 146).   That for Thy hymns it might   Thence pluck fair flowers of light,   Nor leave to thankless winds an offering:   But render back to Thee   Thine own, for Thine they be;   For what of all things is not Thine, O King?   O Father of all fathers, Thou!   To Thine eternal Fatherhood all beings bow!   XIV. ( 147- 157).    26   But Father Thou hadst none;   Thou art the self-sprung One,   Before all worlds the sole great Mind existing:   Germ of whate'er we see,   Spur of all things that be   Root of first worlds, by Thee alone subsisting:   Light of all light, Truth's basis sure;   And Wisdom's everflowing stream, and fountain pure.   XV. ( 158- 165).   O Mind immutable!   O Light inscrutable!   Thine is the eye that guides the lightning fire:   In Thee the ages live,   Thou dost their limits give;   Who can Thy praises reach, Eternal Sire?   Thou art beyond the dreams of men;   Beyond the reach of mind, or highest angel's ken.   XVI. ( 166- 173).    27   O'er all Thy rule is spread,   The living and the dead;   To minds that be, the parent Mind Thou art;   All heaven Thou dost control,   Thou nourishest the soul,   And dost to spirit energy impart;   The Spring Thou art whence all things flow,   And from eternity the Root whence all things grow.   XVII. ( 174- 183).   The only One, yet all;   In Thee all numbers fall;   The only One, yet countless evermore:   The self-existent Mind,   Yet mind with law combined;   Mind's realm, yet all the realm of mind before:   Through all, yet all beyond, art Thou:   To Thee, the Seed of all existing things, we bow.   XVIII. ( 184- 190).    28   Thou art the Eternal Root,   Thou art the spreading Shoot!   Or male or female Thou be called, 'tis one;   To mind Thou nature art,   And dost Thyself impart,   But mind enlightened ne'er can say, 'tis done;   But here and there a word outpours,   While feebly it the unfathomed depth around explores.   XIX. ( 191- 198).   Thou art the Parent Tree,   All have their life from Thee,   Or stem or branch, whatever is, is Thine.   Thou art the Light of light,   The Light of day so bright,   The Light that shineth evermore Divine:   Thou art, again, the hidden Light,   By its own glory hidden far from mortal sight.   XX. ( 199- 209).    29   Yet one, yet all, one Lord,   One only, yet forth poured,   Through all forth poured in holy Mystery:   Of Thee thus sprung the Son,   Wisdom, the glorious One,   Creator of the universe to be.   The Godhead severed into twain   By birth ineffable, unsevered doth remain.   XXI. ( 210- 216).   Yet One, though Twain, though Three:   Mysterious Trinity!   For Thou art One in Three, and Three in One.   I sing Thee, Unity!   I sing Thee, Trinity!   The Triune King, the Father, Spirit, Son!   The Light divided is not spent,   The One pervading mind, though parted, is not rent.   XXII. ( 217- 224).    30   Thy holy Will is done,   'Tis through the Eternal Son;   And from the outpoured Godhead forth there springs,   Which cannot be exprest   In words, the Spirit Blest,   The Uncreated! we of wondrous things   Have spoken; but we speak not there:   We dare not if we could, we could not if we dare.   XXIII. ( 225- 231).   Who knows the Eternal Laws?   Who knows the First Great Cause?   We may not say a Second, or a Third.   O Birth beyond our reach;   O Spring defying speech!   What mortal to the task himself could gird?   O matchless Holy One, between   The Father and the Son Thy Light doth intervene.   XXIV. ( 232- 240).    31   All reverence to Thee,   Eternal Spirit, be!   Thou of the Three the middle rank dost hold.   And now, most glorious Son,   Thy praises be begun!   Thy birth, thy generation, is untold:   The Father's Son, the Father's Will,   With Him Thou present wast, and present Thou art still.   XXV. ( 241- 253)   Thou with the Father art,   And ever next His heart;   Nor can deep flowing Time Thy birth reveal;   Nor aged Aeon say   When was Thy natal day;   He never learned, nor could remove the seal.   Son with the Father! He the same   Who should hereafter give to Aeon birth and name.   XXVI. ( 254- 265).    32   Who hath adjudged the eye   Into God's depths to pry?   The subtle tongue will dare, but man is blind.   Such daring is in vain,   'Tis godless, and profane.   Thou dost to Thine pour light upon the mind,   And guard their hearts with holy care,   That they in darkness sink not through gross matter's snare.   XXVII. ( 266- 275).   To Thee all holy praise   It well befits to raise;   For Thou of all art Father, all are Thine:   Thou all the worlds didst found,   Thou dost all ages bound,   Thou framedst all the host of heaven divine;   To Thee all minds of light do sing,   And starry spheres intelligent hail thee their King!   XXVIII. ( 276- 285).    33   While round in holy choir   Dance their bright orbs of fire,   The blest ones all do shout and sing before Thee;   The world within, around,   They all Thy praise resound,   All in their stations evermore adore Thee:   Those in the zones; and those outside,   Who yet their several posts assigned in wisdom guide.   XXIX. ( 286- 300).   These come to guard, or tame,   Earth's helmsmen, sons of fame;   Of link angelic, and who draw their birth   From old heroic race;   Who ever take their place,   By hidden ways, o'er men and things of earth:   And though of an unyielding will,   To dark-rayed worldly glories ever yield they still.   XXX. ( 301- 311).    34   To Thee blithe nature sings,   And all from her that springs:   For Thou with heavenly breath dost them renew,   Forth pouring from above   Thy stores of grace and love,   Which ever fresh descend in showers and dew;   Thou to all nature nature art,   O Lord of worlds unstained! and dost Thine own impart.   XXXI. ( 312- 319).   For nature Thou didst train   And school, that she again   Might parent be of every mortal thing;   The faithful counterpart   Of all that Thyself art,   Of life and health the everflowing spring!   That to the world's extremest bound   Each part in turn with living beauty might be crowned.   XXXII. ( 320- 328).    35   For it were never right   That things should jar and fight,   Or dregs of earth with excellence contend;   But all by Thy decree   Is wrought in harmony;   Nor aught shall perish, nor the chorus end;   But each from other takes its share,   And all through one another taste Thy loving care.   XXXIII. ( 329- 334).   The eternal wheel revolves,   And the dark riddle solves;   Things die; Thou sendest forth Thy breath, they live,   And in fresh glory bloom,   Renewed from mortal doom.   Thus nurtured nature nurturing doth give;   And she doth sing a deathless song   To Thee by all her children through the ages long.   XXXIV. ( 335- 342).    36   In colour or in skin,   Without, or life within,   And deeds, however varied they may be,   Yet nature moulds them all   Obedient to her call;   And links them fast in holy unity;   And from all creatures thus doth raise   Of differing voices one harmonious hymn of praise.   XXXV. ( 343- 357).   To Thee, their Lord and King,   All things their tribute bring   Of ceaseless praise; the night, the morn, the sky,   The lightning flash, the snow,   And things that spring and grow;   All bodies and all spirits; birds that fly,   And beasts that graze; seeds, plants, and roots;   The sea with all that swims, and earth with all her fruits.   XXXVI. ( 358- 367).    37   The waves of trouble roll;   Look Thou upon my soul,   To act so powerless, to learn so slow,   Where on Thy Libyan sands   The mystic temple stands;   For hither I, Thy holy will to know,   Oppressed with grief, my steps have bent,   On prayer and supplication unto Thee intent.   XXXVII. ( 368- 374).   Before Thy favouring eye   Earth's gloomy vapours fly:   Look Thou on me, and bid my sorrows cease.   'Tis so! e'en now my heart   Through food Thy hymns impart--   For Thine they are--hath nourishment of peace,   And points my mind with keen desire   To rise afresh to thoughts and words of heavenly fire.   XXXVIII. ( 375- 380).    38   But send, O King, Thy light,   To quicken my dull sight,   And guide me on the road that leads to Thee.   And, Father, grant, I pray,   That from the body's sway   My better part, escaping, may be free,   And not again be downward hurled   Beneath the floods and eddies of this troubled world.   XXXIX. ( 381- 391).   Yet here, while in the strife   Of world-enchainèd life,   O Blessèd, may kind fortune smile on me;   Nor stormy tempest blow   To check the holy glow,   Or rudely break the mind's tranquillity;   Lest inrush of the worldly flood   Should leave to me no leisure for the things of God.   XL. ( 392- 400).    39   And whereto I have striven,   By grace which Thou hast given,   (For all good gifts of help and strength are Thine),   May I the ground retain,   Nor e'er fall back again.   For which Thy gifts this humble wreath of mine   From holy fields to Thee I bring,   O Thou of all creations pure the Eternal King;   XLI. ( 402- 409).   To Thee and to Thy Son,   Thine own, the only One,   Alone of Thee begotten, the All-wise,   Whom from eternity   Thou hadst, and hast, with Thee,   Though forth from Thee He came to harmonize   All things, and fashion, form, and guide,   By wisdom's breath outpoured, and over all preside.   XLII. ( 410- 416).    40   The hoary ages wake,   And their due course take,   At his command; and of His matchless skill,   And workmanship divine,   As if by plumb and line,   This rugged world He mouldeth to His will,   Whate'er exists above the ground,   Or on its surface, or within its depths profound.   XLIII. ( 417- 427).   And merciful and kind   He shines with holy mind   On toiling mortals; and doth bring relief;   For He doth loose the chain   Of toilsome care and pain;   Effects their good, and drives away their grief.   The God who did the world create,   What marvel that His own He guard from whelming fate?   XLIV. ( 428- 440).    41   And hither southward now,   That I might pay this vow   To Thee the mighty world's eternal guide,   I came from northern Thrace,   Where three years' dreary space   Near the Imperial Court I did abide,   In toil, with tears and anguish sore,   For on my shoulders I my mother country bore,   XLV. ( 441- 454).   And well Thou know'st, good Lord,   How from my limbs was poured   A sweat of agony from day to day:   Nor rest had I by night   In that dire mental fight:   But watered was the couch on which I lay   From streaming eyes. Then to and fro,   To every shrine a suppliant I made haste to go.   XLVI. ( 455- 462).    42   To all in turn I bring   Prayer, chaplet, offering,   And water with my tears each sacred floor,   That I might not with pain   Have journey made in vain,   But that Thou wouldst wide-open hopeful door.   Thus in my own and country's need   I with Thy holy ones through fruitful Thrace did plead;   XLVII. ( 463- 473).   And who across the main,   Guard Carthaginian plain,   I sought them all, if they might succour me,   Throughout the region round,   Whom Thou with rays hadst crowned   Angelic, Thine attendant saints to be.   The blest ones helped my eager prayers,   They helped my many toils, and soothed my many cares.   XLVIII. ( 474- 489).    43   Life did no pleasure yield,   While my poor country reeled   Half stunned: but Thou hast righted her, O King!   The Rock of Ages Thou,   To whom the world doth bow!   Crushed were my limbs, my soul a lifeless thing:   But Thou from Heaven hast breathed at length   New vigour on my soul, and on my limbs new strength.   XLIX. ( 490- 497).   For Thou hast-brought relief,   And stayed o'erflowing grief:   Toils have an end, the wearied soul hath rest.   'Twas by Thy wisdom planned,   'Twas wrought out by Thy hand.   Thou to my mind hast given refreshment blest.   Now, O my God, do Thou ordain,   That to the Libyans these Thine own sweet gifts remain;   L. ( 498- 505).    44   Of our long tribulation,   Of Thy so great Salvation,   A lasting record! Hear Thy suppliant's prayer;   And henceforth may my life   Be safe from harmful strife.   Loose me from toil, disease, and deadly care.   Thus to Thy servant bow Thine ear,   And grant my mental life be ever bright and clear.   LI. ( 506- 523).   I would not showers of wealth   To try the soul's best health,   And leave no leisure for the things divine;   Nor poverty would I,   With downcast sullen eye,   Black spectre to the house, prone to repine,   Bowed down to earth with earthly cares.   Both grovel on the ground, and both are dangerous snares.   LII. ( 524- 532).    45   And both forgetful are   Of better things by far,   The mind, and all that to the mind doth cling,   Unless, O heavenly Friend,   Thou shouldst Thy help extend.   Yea, Father, wisdom's holy self and spring,   Upon this faltering soul of mine   The light of mind from Thine own bosom cause to shine.   LIII. ( 533- 543).   And on my heart, I pray,   Turn Thou blest wisdom's ray,   With helping hand, and point the holy road   That leadeth unto Thee;   And set Thy seal on me,   And let me have the token of my God;   And from my life, and from my prayer,   Drive earthly demons of presumption and despair.   LIV. ( 544- 553).    46   And may my body be   From all dishonour free,   As fortress unassailable to foe;   And may my spirit pure   Unto the end endure   By Thine all-saving help. Full well I know,   That I do bear dark worldly stain,   And held in bondage am by earthly passions' chain;   LV. ( 544- 563).   But Thou deliverer art,   And cleanser of the heart.   From evils circling round escape afford,   And from diseases all,   And bonds that fret and gall.   I bear Thy seed, of noble mind, good Lord,   A spark that issued forth from Thee,   And flashing down through depths of matter lit on me.   LVI. ( 564- 574).    47   For in the world, O King,   Thou mad'st a soul to spring,   And in the body, through the soul, a mind:   O pity then Thine own,   The handmaid from Thy throne:   From Thee descending, hapless I did bind   Myself as labourer free to earth:   Not labourer now, but slave, downfallen from my birth.   LVII. ( 575- 585).   For, me the world around   With witchery hath bound,   Some little strength may yet remain in me   Of secret inner light,   Not yet extinguished quite:   But o'er my head is rolled a mighty sea,   That doth make blind the mental eye   That would its God and things of heavenly worth descry.   LVIII. ( 586- 592).    48   O look with pitying eye,   And hear the mournful cry   Of Thine own child, O Father good and kind:   Whom oft when she would rise   Up to her native skies,   Impelled by holy efforts of the mind,   Yet fascination of this world   Hath choked, and back to earth's dark mazes hurled.   LIX. ( 593- 602).   But O! send forth Thy light,   A beacon fire through night,   To guide' and cheer me on my upward way;   And may that seed take root,   And, striking out its shoot   From small beginning, bead of flower display.   O Father, such Thy help divine,   Enthrone me in the light of life above to shine;   LX. ( 603- 611).    49   Where nature cannot clasp   With her resistless grasp:   And whence no longer earth, or web of fate,   Can back recall to woe   And vain desires below.   Let brood deceitful that I scorn and hate   Of worldly passions scattered be,   And leave thy servant, O my God, at peace with Thee!   LXI. ( 612- 627).   Me and earth's din betwixt   Be fiery barrier fixed.   Thy grace, O Father, to my soul reveal;   And let thy suppliant find,   With outspread wings of mind,   The ascending path, and bear aloft Thy seal,   A terror to the up-springing foe,   Who breathe to mortals godless thoughts from depths below;   LXII. ( 628- 635).    50   But badge and token known   To those about Thy throne,   The holy ones, who all the heights survey   Of Thy bright world, and stand   As guards in high command,   Bearing the keys of upward fiery way,   That they may give an entrance free,   And open wide the gates of heavenly light to me.   LXIII. ( 636- 645),   But still while creeping here   Upon this empty sphere   Of earth, yet not of earth grant me to be;   But from a better root   E'en here attesting fruit   To bear of fire-proved deeds, my God, to Thee;   And Thy true voice to hear and know,   And whate'er warms and makes in souls blest hope to grow.   LXIV. ( 646- 653).    51   It doth me now repent   Of life on earth ill-spent:   Begone, the blear-eyed haze of godless men,   And built-up cities' strength   Begone, ye breadth and length   Of worldly aims, nor harass me again,   Ye sweet calamities, ye toys   Of mighty seeming, bootless boons, and joyless joys.   LXV. ( 654- 661).   Tranced by your bravery   The soul in slavery   To earth is held; and wretched is indeed;   For of her own good things   This cup oblivion brings:   And things, wherewith to satisfy her need   She hoped, are forthwith snatched away;   And from vain dream she wakes to envy's shaft a prey.   LXVI. ( 662- 670).    52   For fortune here below   A double face doth show,   False queen: whom if you haply win and trust,   And in her livery shine,   And at her table dine,   Soon rue your lot with bitter tears you must,   When down from pedestal so high   You fall in widespread ruin, and neglected lie.   LXVII. ( 672- 683).   For here, from adverse sides,   Now good, now ill, betides:   To mortals such is life's necessity.   To God, or what hath birth   From God, but not to earth,   Is good unmingled with adversity.   Did cup of sweets intoxicate?   Ensnared I learnt by crop of woes a lesson late.   LXVIII. ( 684- 693).    53   I hate these laws of change   And hence now upward range,   With wings expanded, to the peaceful sky:   To bright ethereal plains,   Where my dear Father reigns,   From earth, and earths two-sided gifts I fly.   O Steward of the life of mind,   To Thee I look; with Thee may I acceptance find.   LXIX. ( 694- 703).   My soul doth hang on Thee:   Heed Thou Thy suppliant's plea,   Bound here on earth, yet struggling to ascend   The upward paths of mind:   As Thou thus far hast shined,   O shine yet more: light wings of succour lend   Snap double passions' bond, and chain   Of earth unloose, and let my soul her freedom gain.   LXX. ( 704- 713).    54   For nature by these chains   Her treacherous power obtains,   And binds me down to earth a helpless prey;   But from the body freed,   And all its direful need,   Grant me to take swift flight to realms of day,   To Thine own halls and Thine own breast,   Whence flows the Fountain of the soul; and be at rest.   LXXI. ( 714- 725).   A drop from Fountain Head   Poured, forth, to earth I sped,   An exile and a wanderer from Thee;   Me now, I pray, restore   To where I was before:   With light ancestral may I mingled be!   Tune Thou my mind with Thine own choir   In holiness to sing the hymns Thou dost inspire.   LXXII. ( 726- 734).    55   Once saved from mortal plight,   Once mingled with the light,   O Father, grant I never enter more   Within earth's black domains   Of penalties and pains;   But while I yet am chained to this dark shore,   And bear life's drudgery below,   Bid Thou that fortune's breezes on me gently blow.

1 The spacious firmament on high,   with all the blue ethereal sky,   and spangled heavens, a shining frame,   their great Original proclaim.   The unwearied sun from day to day   does his Creator's power display,   and publishes to every land   the work of an almighty hand. 2 Soon as the evening shades prevail   the moon takes up the wondrous tale,   and nightly to the listening earth   repeats the story of her birth;   whilst all the stars that round her burn,   and all the planets in their turn,   confirm the tidings, as they roll,   and spread the truth from pole to pole. 3 What though in solemn silence all   move round the dark terrestrial ball;   what though nor real voice nor sound   amid their radiant orbs be found;   in reason's ear they all rejoice,   and utter forth a glorious voice,   for ever singing as they shine,   'The hand that made us is divine.'

The lengthening light of summer day,   The winter frost, Thy power display,   Nature proclaims Thy sovereign skill;   Man, and man only, spurns Thy will.    3.

1 King of glory, King of peace,   I will love Thee;   and that love may never cease,   I will move Thee.   Thou hast granted my request,   Thou hast heard me;   Thou didst note my working breast,   Thou hast spared me.    2 Wherefore with my utmost art   I will sing Thee,   and the cream of all my heart   I will bring Thee.   Though my sins against me cried,   Thou didst clear me;   and alone, when they replied,   Thou didst hear me.    3 Sev'n whole days, not one in sev'n,   I will praise Thee;   in my heart, though not in heav'n,   I can raise Thee.

1 Beneath the cross of Jesus   I fain would take my stand,   the shadow of a mighty Rock   within a weary land;   a home within the wilderness,   a rest upon the way,   from the burning of the noontide heat   and the burden of the day.    2 Upon the cross of Jesus   mine eye at times can see   the very dying form of One   who suffered there for me:   and from my stricken heart with tears   two wonders I confess,   the wonders of redeeming love   and my unworthiness.    3 I take, O cross, thy shadow   for my abiding place:   I ask no other sunshine than   the sunshine of his face;   content to let the world go by,   to know no gain nor loss;   my sinful self my only shame,   my glory all the cross.

Though fiercely strive the hosts of ill   Within us, and around us,   With fiendish strength, and fiendish skill,   Yet neer may they confound us.

Our Fathers truth abideth sure;   Christ, our Redeemer, liveth;   For us He pleads His offering pure,   To us His Spirit giveth.

Who for Him will go?   By Thy call of mercy, by Thy grace divine,   We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine!    2. Not for weight of glory, nor for crown and palm,   Enter we the army, raise the warrior psalm;   But for love that claimeth lives for whom He died:   He whom Jesus saveth marches on His side.   By Thy love constraining, by Thy grace divine,   We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine!    3. Jesus, Thou hast bought us, not with gold or gem,   But with Thine own lifeblood, for Thy diadem;   With Thy blessing filling each who comes to Thee,   Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free.   By Thy grand redemption, by Thy grace divine,   We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine!    4. Fierce may be the conflict, strong may be the foe,   But the Kings own army none can overthrow;   Round His standard ranging, victry is secure,   For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure.   Joyfully enlisting, by Thy grace divine,   We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine!    5. Chosen to be soldiers, in an alien land,   Chosen, called, and faithful, for our Captains band;   In the service royal, let us not grow cold,   Let us be right loyal, noble, true and bold.   Master, wilt Thou keep us, by Thy grace divine,   Always on the Lords sideSavior, always Thine!     Source:  50 Favorites: and July  2013 index of supplement to Evening Light Songs # 50

1. What are these that glow from afar,   These that lean over the golden bar,   Strong as the lion, pure as the dove,   With open arms, and hearts of love?   They the blessèd ones gone before,   They the blessèd for evermore;   Out of great tribulation they went   Home to their home of Heaven content.    2. What are these that fly as a cloud,   With flashing heads and faces bowed;   In their mouths a victorious psalm,   In their hands a robe and palm?   Welcoming angels these that shine,   Your own angel, and yours, and mine;   Who have hedged us, both day and night   On the left hand and the right.    3. Light above light, and bliss beyond bliss,   Whom words cannot utter, lo, who is this?   As a king with many crowns He stands,   And our names are gravn upon His hands;   As a priest, with God-uplifted eyes,   He offers for us His sacrifice;   As the Lamb of God, for sinners slain,   That we too may live, He lives again.    4. God the Father give us grace   To walk in the light of Jesus face;   God the Son give us a part   In the hiding-place of Jesus heart;   God the Spirit so hold us up   That we may drink of Jesus cup;   God Almighty, God Three in One,   God Almighty, God alone.

1. Rise at the cry of battle,   Arm for the coming strife,   By night and day you must fight your way   Till you pass through death to life.   Ready to face the danger,   Ready to right the wrong,   There is many a foe on the way you go,   Quit you like men, be strong!    2. Fiery and fierce the conflict,   Daring and swift the foe;   His hosts are found on the battle ground,   Where they wait to lay you low;   Sharp are his darts and deadly,   Keen is the strife and long,   Then arm for the fight in the armor of light,   Quit you like men, be strong!    3. Strive till the strife is over,   Fight till the fight is won,   Though sore oppressed, seek not for rest,   Until the day is done;   After the well fought battle   Join in the victorÂ’s song,   Your trophies bring to Christ your King,   Quit you like men, be strong!

1. The voice says, Cry! What shall we cry?   All flesh is grass, and like the flower   Its glories droop, its pleasures die,   Its joys but last one fleeting hour.    2. The voice says, Cry! O piteous cry!   And are there none to help and save?   Have all that live beneath the sky   No other prospect but a grave?    3. The voice says, Cry! Yet glorious cry!   The Word of God can never fall,   And tells how Jesus, throned on high,   Holds out eternal life to all.    4. The voice says, Cry! Who needs the cry?   O brother men! who needs it not?   By countless millions, far and nigh,   Tis still unheard, despised, forgot.    5. The voice says, Cry! What stops the cry?   Our greed of wealth, our love of ease,   Our lack of earnest will to try   Mankind to save, and God to please.    6. The voice says, Cry! O let us cry!   Though standing on deaths awful brink,   Men feast, they jest, they sell, they buy,   And cannot see, and will not think.    7. The voice says, Cry! Lord, we would cry   But of Thy goodness teach us how;   For fast the hours of mercy fly,   And, if we cry, it must be now!     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 7083

1 Still throned in heaven, to men in unbelief   Christ spreads his hands all day;   They scan his claims, give judgement cold and brief,   And fearless turn away.    2 Once more, O peerless mystery of grace,   Thy sweet appeal renew;   Light up dark minds, win souls to thine embrace,   High forts of doubt subdue.    3 Speak, till the sons of men with hearts unseared,   Led by that voice of thine,   Find thee each day more glorious, more endeared,   Christ human, Christ divine.

HYMN 689
1 Once to every man and nation   Comes the moment to decide,   In the strife of truth with falsehood,   For the good or evil side;   Some great cause, God's new Messiah,   Offering each the bloom or blight,   And the choice goes by forever   Twixt that darkness and that light.    2 Then to side with truth is noble,   When we share her wretched crust,   Ere her cause bring fame and profit,   And 'tis prosperous to be just;   Then it is the brave man chooses   While the coward stands aside,   Till the multitude make virtue   Of the faith they had denied.    3 By the light of burning martyrs,   Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,   Toiling up new Calvaries ever   With the cross that turns not back;   New occasions teach new duties,   Time makes ancient good uncouth;   They must upward still and onward,   Who would keep abreast of truth.    4 Though the cause of evil prosper,   Yet 'tis truth alone is strong;   Though her portion be the scaffold,   And upon the throne be wrong:   Yet that scaffold sways the future,   And, behind the dim unknown,   Standeth God within the shadow   Keeping watch above His own.

1 Quiet, Lord, my froward heart;   Make me teachable and mild,   Upright, simple, free from art;   Make me as a weaned child,   From distrust and envy free,   Pleased with all that pleases Thee.    2 What Thou shalt to-day provide   Let me as a child receive;   What to-morrow may betide   Calmly to Thy wisdom leave:   'Tis enough that Thou wilt care;   Why should I the burden bear?    3 As a little child relies   On a care beyond his own,   Knows he's neither strong nor wise,   Fears to stir a step alone,--   Let me thus with Thee abide,   As my Father, Guard, and Guide.    4 Thus preserved from Satan's wiles,   Safe from dangers, free from fears,   May I live upon Thy smiles   Till the promised hour appears,   When the sons of God shall prove   All their Father's boundless love.

Change marches onward: may all change blest!    3.

1 Be still, my soul! For God is near!   The great High Priest is with thee now;   the Lord of Life himself is near,   before whose face the angels bow.    2 To make thy heart his lowly throne   thy Saviour God in love draws nigh;   he gives himself unto his own,   for whom he once came down to die.    3 He pleads before the mercy-seat;   he pleads with God; he pleads for thee;   he gives thee bread from heaven to eat,   his flesh and blood in mystery.    4 I come, O Lord! For thou dost call    to blend my pleading prayer with thine;   to thee I give myself  my all,   and feed on thee and make thee mine.     Source: CPWI Hymnal # 572

1 The year is gone, beyond recall,   with all its hopes and fears,   with all its bright and gladdening smiles,   with all its mourners tears;    2 thy thankful people praise thee, Lord,   for countless gifts received;   and pray for grace to keep the faith   which Saints of old believed.    3 To thee we come, O gracious Lord,   the new-born year to bless;   defend our land from pestilence;   hive peace and plenteousness;    4 forgive this nations many sins;   the growth of vice restrain;   and help us all with sin to strive,   and crowns of life to gain.    5 From evil deeds that stain the past   we now desire to flee;   and pray that future years may all   be spent, good Lord, for thee.    6 O Father, let thy watchful eye   still look on us in love,   that we may praise thee, year by year,   with angel-hosts above.    7 All glory to the Father be,   all glory to the Son,   all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,   while endless ages run.

1 We hail thee now, O Jesus:   thy presence here we own,   though sight and touch have failed us,   and faith perceives alone.   Thy love has veiled thy glory   and hid thy power divine,   in mercy to our weakness,   beneath an earthly sign.    2 We hail thee now, O Jesus:   in silence hast thou come,   for all the hosts of heaven   with wonderment are dumb --   so great the condescension,   so marvellous the love,   which for our sakes, O Saviour,   have drawn thee from above.    3 We hail thee now, O Jesus:   for law and type have ceased,   and thou in each communion   art sacrifice and priest.   We make this great memorial   in union, Lord, with thee,   and plead thy death and passion   to cleanse and set us free.    4 We hail thee now, O Jesus:   for death is ever near,   and in thy presence only   its terrors disappear.   Dwell with us, sweetest Saviour,   and guide us through the night,   till shadows end in glory.   and faith be lost in sight.     Source: Common Praise ( 1998) # 80

1 Behold a little Child   Laid in a manger bed,   The wintry blasts blow wild . . .   Around His infant head;   But who is this so lowly laid?   'Tis He by whom the worlds were made.    2 Alas! in what poor state   The Son of God is seen;   Why doth the Lord so great   Choose out a home so mean?   That we may learn from pride to flee,   And follow His humility.    3 Where Joseph plies his trade,   Lo! Jesus labours too;   The hands that all things made   An earthly craft pursue,   That weary men on Him may rest,   And faithful toil in Him be blest.    4 Among the doctors see   The Boy so full of grace:   Say, wherefore taketh He   The scholar's lowly place?   That Christian boys with reverence meet   May sit and learn at Jesus' feet.    5 Christ! once Thyself a boy,   Our boyhood guard and guide;   Be Thou its light and joy,   And still with us abide;   That Thy dear love, so great, so free,   May draw us evermore to Thee.

1 When his salvation bringing,   to Zion Jesus came,   the children all stood singing   hosannas to his name:   nor did their zeal offend him,   but as he rode along,   he let them still attend him,   and smiled to hear their song.    2 And since the Lord retaineth   his love for children still,   though now as King he reigneth   on Zion's heav'nly hill,   we'll flock around his banner   who sits upon his throne,   and cry aloud, "Hosanna   to David's royal Son!"    3 For should we fail proclaiming   our great Redeemer's praise,   the stones, our silence shaming,   would their hosannas raise.

1. Two brothers freely cast their lot   With Davids royal Son;   The cost of conquest counting not,   They deem the battle won.    2. Brothers in heart, they hope to gain   An undivided joy,   That man may one with man remain,   As boy was one with boy.    3. Christ heard; and willed that James should fall   First prey of Satans rage;   John linger out his fellows all,   And die in bloodless age.    4. Now they join hands once more above   Before the Conquerors throne!   Thus God grants prayer; but in His love   Makes times and ways His own.    5.

1. O Captain of Gods host, whose dreadful might   Led forth to war the armèd seraphim,   And from the starry height,   Subdued in burning light,   Cast down that ancient dragon dark and grim;    2. Thine angels, Christ, we laud in solemn lays,   Our elder brethren of the crystal sky,   Who mid Thy glorys blaze   The ceaseless anthem raise   And gird Thy throne in faithful ministry.    3. We celebrate their love, whose viewless wing   Hath left for us so oft their mansion high,   The mercies of their King   To mortal saints to bring,   Or guard the couch of slumbring infancy.    4. But Thee, the First and Last, we glorify,   Who, when Thy world was sunk in death and sin,   Not with Thine hierarchy,   The armies of the sky,   But didst with Thine own arm the battle win;    5. Alone didst pass the dark and dismal shore,   Alone didst tread the winepress, and alone,   All glorious in Thy gore,   Didst light and life restore   To us who lay in darkness and undone.    6. Therefore with angels and archangels we   To Thy dear love our thankful chorus raise,   And tune our songs to Thee   Who art, and art to be,   And, endless as Thy mercies, sound Thy praise.

1. All praise be to God, whom all things obey,   From angels and men for ever and aye:   Who sendeth on earth the powers of His throne,   His providence good and love to make known.    2. His angels are they of countenance fair,   The arm of His strength, His hand of kind care:   His message of peace to us they reveal,   His wisdom most high they seal or unseal.    3. By martyrs of old they stood in the flame,   And bade them not flinch, but call on Gods name.   Thro torment, thro shame, thro darkness of death   They led without fear the sires of our faith.    4. They stand with the few, they fight for the free,   Gods reign to advance oer land and oer sea:   And when the brave die or fall in the fight,   Their spirits they bear to rest in Gods sight.    5. For patience and toil a crown they prepare;   They found for the meek a kingdom full fair;   No famine nor plague gainst them doth prevail;   Their bread cannot lack, their cruse cannot fail.    6.

Anthems be to you addressed,   God in man made manifest.    3 Manifest in making whole   palsied limbs and fainting soul;   manifest in valiant fight,   quelling all the devil's might;   manifest in gracious will,   ever bringing good from ill:   Anthems be to you addressed,   God in man made manifest.    4 Sun and moon shall darkened be,   stars shall fall, the heav'ns shall flee.   Christ will then like lightning shine;   all will see his glorious sign.   All will then the trumpet hear,   all will see the judge appear.   You by all will be confessed,   God in man made manifest.    5 Grant us grace to see you, Lord,   mirrored in your holy Word.   May our lives and all we do   imitate and honor you   that we all like you may be   at your great epiphany   and may praise you, ever blest,   God in man made manifest.

1 Creator of the world, to thee   an endless rest of joy belongs;   and heavenly choirs are ever free   to sing on high their festal songs.    2 But we are fallen creatures here,   where pain and sorrow daily come;   and how can we in exile drear   sing out, as they, sweet songs of home?    3 O Father, who dost promise still   that they who mourn shall bless√®d be,   grant us to weep for deeds of ill   that banish us so long from thee:    4 but, weeping, grant us faith to rest   in hope upon thy loving care;   till thou restore us, with the blest,   their songs of praise in heaven to share.    5 To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,   the God whom heaven and earth adore,   from men and from the angel-host   be praise and glory evermore.

1 Once more the solemn season calls   A holy fast to keep;   And now within the temple walls   Both priest and people weep.    2 But vain all outward sign of grief,   And vain the form of prayer,   Unless the heart implore relief,   And penitence be there.    3 We smite the breast, we weep in vain,   In vain in ashes mourn,   Unless with penitential pain   The smitten soul be torn.    4 In sorrow true then let us pray   To our offended God,   From us to turn His wrath away,   And stay the uplifted rod.    5 O God, our Judge and Father, deign   To spare the bruis√®d reed;   We pray for time to turn again,   For grace to turn indeed.    6 Blest Three in One, to Thee we bow;   Vouchsafe us in Thy love   To gather from these fasts below   Immortal fruit above.

1. By precepts taught of ages past,   Now let us keep again the fast,   Which, year by year, in order meet   Of forty days is made complete.    2. The law and seers that were of old   In divers ways this Lent foretold,   Which Christ Himself, the Lord and guide   Of every season, sanctified.    3. More sparing therefore let us make   The words we speak, the food we take,   Deny ourselves in mirth and sleep,   In stricter watch our senses keep.    4. In prayer together let us fall,   And cry for mercy, one and all;   And weep before the Judge, and say,   O turn from us Thy wrath away.    5. Thy grace have we offended sore   By sins, O God, which we deplore;   Pour down upon us from above   The riches of Thy pardoning love.    6. Remember, Lord, though frail we be,   That yet Thine handiwork are we:   Nor let the honor of Thy name   Be by another put to shame.    7. Forgive the ill that we have wrought,   Increase the good that we have sought;   That we at length, our wanderings oÂ’er,   May please Thee now and evermore.    8. Blest Three in One, and One in Three,   Almighty God, we pray to Thee,   That Thou wouldst now vouchsafe to bless   Our fast with fruits of righteousness.     Source: The Cyber Hymnal # 712

Each heart is manifest to Thee;   Thou knowest our infirmity:   Repentant now we seek Thy face;   Impart to us Thy pardoning grace.    3.

1 Good it is to keep the fast   shadowed forth in ages past,   which our own Almighty Lord   hallowed by his deed and word.    2 Moses, while he fasted, saw   God who gave by him the law;   to Elijah angels came,   steeds of fire and car of flame.    3 So was Daniel meet to gaze   on the sight of latter days   and the Baptist to proclaim   blessings through the BridegroomÂ’s name.    4 Grant us, Lord, like them to be   oft in prayer and fast with thee;   fill us with thy heavenly might,   be our joy and true delight.    5 Father, hear us through thy Son,   and the Spirit, with thee One,   whom our thankful hearts adore   ever and for evermore.

A time in which towards paradise,   Once lost by carnal sense,   The souls redeemed by Thee may rise   Through chastening abstinence.    3. Now with Thy Church be present, Lord,   In all Thy saving grace,   And hear us as with one accord   Mourning, we seek Thy face.    4.

Christian, never tremble;   never be down-cast;   smite them by the virtue   of the Lenten fast.    3 Christian, dost thou hear them,   how they speak thee fair?   'Always fast and vigil?   Always watch and prayer?'
