<p><br/>1 O Light, from age to age the same, <br/> O ever-living Word, <br/> Here have we felt thy kindling flame, <br/> Thy voice within have heard. <br/> <br/>2 Here holy thought and hymn and prayer <br/> Have winged the spiritÂs powers, <br/> And made these walls divinely fair, <br/> Thy temple, Lord, and ours. <br/> <br/>3 What visions rise above the years, <br/> What tender memories throng, <br/> Till each eye fills with happy tears, <br/> Each heart with happy song! <br/> <br/>4 Vanish the mists of time and sense; <br/> They come, the loved of yore, <br/> And one encircling providence <br/> Holds all for evermore. <br/> <br/>5 O not in vain their toil, who wrought <br/> To build faithÂs freer shrine; <br/> Nor theirs, whose steadfast love and thought <br/> Have watched the fire divine. <br/> <br/>6 Burn, holy Fire, and shine more wide! <br/> While systems rise and fall, <br/> Faith, hope, and charity abide, <br/> The heart and soul of all. <br/> <br/> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br/>247</p>
