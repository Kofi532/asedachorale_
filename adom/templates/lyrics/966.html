<p><br/>1 Earth below is teeming, <br/> HeavÂn is bright above; <br/> EvÂry brow is beaming <br/> In the light of love; <br/> EvÂry eye rejoices, <br/> EvÂry thought is praise: <br/> Happy hearts and voices <br/> Gladden nights and days. <br/> Refrain: <br/> O Almighty Giver! <br/> Bountiful and free, <br/> As the joy in harvest <br/> Joy we before thee. <br/> <br/>2 For the sun and showers, <br/> For the rain and dew, <br/> For the happy hours <br/> Spring and Summer knew; <br/> For the golden Autumn <br/> And its precious stores, <br/> For the love that brought them <br/> Teeming to our doors. [Refrain] <br/> <br/>3 EarthÂs broad harvest whitens <br/> In a brighter sun <br/> Than the orb that lightens <br/> All we tread upon; <br/> Send our labÂrers, Father! <br/> Where fields ripÂning wave, <br/> And the nations gather, <br/> Gather in and save. [Refrain] <br/> <br/> Source: Gloria Deo: a Collection of Hymns and Tunes for Public Worship in all Departments of the Church #<br/>581</p>
