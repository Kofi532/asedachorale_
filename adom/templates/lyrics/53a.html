        <p><br>1 God is Love; His mercy brightens <br> All the path in which we rove; <br> Bliss He wakes and woe He lightens: <br> God is wisdom, God is love. <br> <br>2 Chance and change are busy ever; <br> Man decays, and ages move; <br> But His mercy waneth never: <br> God is wisdom, God is love. <br> <br>3 E'en the hour that darkest seemeth <br> Will His changeless goodnees prove; <br> From the gloom His brighness streameth; <br> God is wisdom, God is love. <br> <br>4 He with earthly cares entwineth <br> Hope and comfort from above; <br> Everywhere His glory shineth; <br> God is wisdom, God is love. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Worship and Service Hymnal: For Church, School, and Home #<br>2</p>
