<p><br/>1 Hear us, O Lord, from heaven Thy dwelling-place: <br/> Like them of old, in vain we toil all night, <br/> Unless with us Thou go, who art the Light; <br/> Come then, O Lord, that we may see Thy face. <br/> <br/>2 Thou, Lord, dost rule the raging of the sea, <br/> When loud the storm and furious is the gale: <br/> Strong is Thine arm; our little barques are frail: <br/> Send us Thy help; remember Galilee. <br/> <br/>3 Our wives and children we commend to Thee: <br/> For them we plough the land and plough the deep; <br/> For them by day the golden corn we reap, <br/> By night the silver harvest of the sea. <br/> <br/>4 We thank Thee, Lord, for sunshine, dew, and rain, <br/> Broadcast from heaven by Thine almighty hand <br/> Source of all life, unnumbered as the sand <br/> Bird, beast, and fish, herb, fruit, and golden grain. <br/> <br/>5 O Bread of Life, Thou in Thy Word hast said, <br/> Who feeds in faith on Me shall never die! <br/> In mercy hear Thy hungry children's cry, <br/> Father, give us this day our daily bread! <br/> <br/>6 Sow in our hearts the seeds of Thy dear love, <br/> That we may reap contentment, joy, and peace; <br/> And when at last our earthly labours cease, <br/> Grant us to join Thy harvest home above. <br/> <br/> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br/>466</p>
