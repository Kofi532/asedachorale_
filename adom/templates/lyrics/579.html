        <p><br>1 Savior, Thy dying love <br> Thou gavest me, <br> Nor should I aught withhold, <br> Dear Lord, from Thee: <br> In love my soul would bow, <br> My heart fulfill its vow, <br> Some off'ring bring Thee now, <br> Something for Thee. <br> <br>2 At the blest mercy seat, <br> Pleading for me, <br> My feeble faith looks up, <br> Jesus, to Thee: <br> Help me the cross to bear, <br> Thy wondrous love declare, <br> Some song to raise, or pray'r, <br> Something for Thee. <br> <br>3 Give me a faithful heart, <br> Likeness to Thee, <br> That each departing day <br> Henceforth may see <br> Some work of love begun, <br> Some deed of kindness done, <br> Some wand'rer sought and won, <br> Something for Thee. <br> <br>4 All that I am and have, <br> Thy gifts so free, <br> In joy, in grief, thro' life, <br> Dear Lord, for Thee! <br> And when Thy face I see, <br> My ransom'd soul shall be, <br> Thro' all eternity, <br> Something for Thee. <br> Baptist Hymnal, <br>1991</p>
