        <p><br>1 We come unto our Savior God <br> with each past generation; <br> th'eternal arms, their dear abode, <br> we make our habitation. <br> We bring thee, Lord, the praise they brought; <br> we seek thee as thy saints have sought <br> in ev'ry generation. <br> <br>2 Their joy unto their Lord we bring, <br> their song to us descendeth; <br> the Spirit who in them did sing <br> to us his music lendeth; <br> his song in them, in us, is one; <br> we raise it high, we send it onÃÂ <br> the song that never endeth. <br> <br>3 Ye saints to come, take up the strain, <br> the same sweet theme endeavor; <br> unbroken be the golden chain! <br> Keep on the song forever! <br> Safe in the same dear dwelling place, <br> rich with the same eternal grace, <br> bless the same boundless giver! <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Rejoice in the Lord #<br>399</p>
