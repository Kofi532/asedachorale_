<p><br/>1 Join all the glorious names <br/> of wisdom, love, and pow'r, <br/> that ever mortals knew, <br/> that angels ever bore; <br/> all are too mean to speak His worth, <br/> too mean to set my Savior forth. <br/> <br/>2 Great Prophet of my God, <br/> my tongue would bless Thy Name; <br/> by Thee the joyful news <br/> of our salvation came- <br/> the joyful news of sins forgiv'n, <br/> of hell subdued, and peace with heav'n. <br/> <br/>3 Jesus, my great High Priest, <br/> offered His blood and died; <br/> my guilty conscience seeks <br/> no sacrifice beside: <br/> His pow'rful blood did once atone, <br/> and now it pleads before the throne. <br/> <br/>4 My dear Almighty Lord, <br/> my Conqueror and King, <br/> Thy sceptre and Thy sword, <br/> Thy reigning grace I sing; <br/> Thine is the pow'r; behold I sit, <br/> in willing bonds, beneath Thy feet. <br/> <br/>5 Now let my soul arise, <br/> and tread the tempter down; <br/> my Captain leads me forth <br/> to conquest and a crown. <br/> A feeble saint shall win the day, <br/> tho' death and hell obstruct the way. <br/> <br/> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br/>317</p>
