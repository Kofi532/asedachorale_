        <p><br>1 O GOD, of good the unfathomed sea! <br> Who would not give his heart to Thee? <br> Who would not love Thee with his might? <br> O Jesu, lover of mankind, <br> Who would not his whole soul and mind, <br> With all his strength, to Thee unite.<br>2 Thou shin'st with everlasting rays; <br> Before th'insufferable blaze <br> Angels with both wings veil their eyes: <br> Yet free as air Thy bounty streams <br> On all Thy works; Thy mercy's beams <br> Diffusive as Thy sun's arise.<br>3 Fountain of good! All blessing flows <br> From Thee; no want Thy fulness knows; <br> What but Thyself canst Thou desire? <br> Yet, self-sufficient as Thou art, <br> Thou dost desire my worthless heart; <br> This, only this, dost Thou require.<br>4 High throned on heav'n's eternal hill, <br> In number, weight, and measure still <br> Thou sweetly orderest all that is: <br> And yet Thou deign'st to come to me, <br> And guide my steps, that I, with Thee <br> Enthroned, may reign in endless bliss. <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>11</p>
